You are the factor that can alter character's story for better or worse. Even the supporting characters are influenced by the decisions you make. There's a different end for everyone depending on your choices. Netflix says that there are 5 ""main endings"" with multiple variants of each. When you watch it again after watching, it makes you feel like you're watching a different movie. Netflix has found a way to make it a deeply personal experience. You feel responsible for the character's choices. It's really fun to have the options in the hands of the audience. And for a first attempt, Netflix succeeds.

35883057,29 December 2018,"[<div class=""text show-more__control"">So, I am going against the main stream here (can't remember the number of reviews mentioning ""mind blowing""....)
I thought the base concept of Bandersnatch was pretty original and the execution extremely ambitious; the main problem I had with it was that the executional device (the interactivity) ended up hijacking the story in so far that I was more carried away by the choices I had to make than by the flow of the story itself.
The way the plot is constructed is like a glass maze, where you keep wandering around and after a while you realise you are where you were a few minutes before; so, in the same way, I found myself watching several times the same sequence and, in all honesty, after 3-4 times, it started being a little repetitive.
In reality, this is more of a videogame where you want to ""win"" by making the choices that brings you to the next ending, and this took away the sheer pleasure of watching a story.
But in the end, the deadly sin of Bandersnatch is that the story is not that interesting, so the idea of watching it in loop (all of it or just parts of it) was not really motivating.
Sorry, it did not blow my mind away...</div>]",9495224
7826013,7 January 2019,"[<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">I consider ""Black Mirror"" to be the best anthology series since Rod Serling's ""The Twilight Zone"". That's how highly I regard the show. Unfortunately, when it comes to the choose-your-own-adventure interactive ""Bandersnatch"", I left the experience wishing a ""normal"" episode or film had been released instead of this experiment.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Bandersnatch"" tells the story of Stefan (Fionn Whitehead), a computer programmer in the 1980s who is working on a path-choosing game at the same company as his idol (and fellow master programmer) Colin (Will Poulter). While creating the game, Stefan becomes convinced that someone else is controlling his actions, much like the characters he himself is creating.<br/><br/>With such a unique concept as ""Bandersnatch""--letting the viewer choose certain decisions for the characters--both the plot and convention must be evaluated. In this case, however, it is difficult to untangle one from the other, as the filmmakers intentionally break the fourth wall on numerous occasions. In other words, it is impossible to separate ""the plot"" from ""the choices"".<br/><br/>Though there were a few things that ""Bandersnatch"" did which intrigued me (mostly located in the first 20-30 minutes of the experience, the poor star rating ultimately came down to this for me: with every ""wrong"" ending I took--thus having to go back and try again--I felt a bit more removed from the overall story and thus my stake in the characters. To be honest, it is almost the exact same emotion I experienced while reading choose-your-own-adventure books as a child. They were fun for awhile, but after a time I became fatigued by the back-and-forth and wanted to get back to more traditional storytelling techniques.<br/><br/>This is to say nothing that with every back-track, I felt like I was continually being taken out of the plot and having to remember what was happening. This worked for about the first half hour or so, but after that it got really messy for my viewing experience.<br/><br/>So, while I have to give ""Black Mirror"" at least some credit for putting a new idea out there for people to experiment with, at the end of the day I wished I would have had more of their standard episodes instead. To be completely honest, I don't think that this type of choice-based content watching will ever be more than a fad or gimmick, although of course that remains to be seen.<br/><br/>For this viewer, however, I prefer to be able to relax and enjoy one story carefully crafted by a team of filmmakers. Adding in audience participation just makes things really, really messy when all is said and done.</div>]",9495224

However, for this particular title the choices are rather uninteresting and there isn't really a ""choice"" when you are choosing between very close actions. Basically whatever you chose gets you to similar points so not really a choice based ending.
I don't think the choices were very wise chosen and overall the plot of the movie was not very great. I mean it's interesting but nothing new or groundbreaking compared to other episodes from Black Mirror, that is, mind you, a darn good TV show.
I think an interactive movie based on Juniper City or Metalheads episodes would've turned much much better. There is also some sort of disparity between what you chose, what the character does in the movie and what happens in the scene. Meaning that somehow you choose what the other characters are doing with your choices instead of the main character, and that's also a bit confusing and a bit of a drag for me.

Yes, there was a lot of anticipation of what would happen next, but overall, due to the frequent pauses to choose, there was no continuity or involvement in the story per se. Some of the choices too felt pretty childish. The idea that the character was actually feeling like he had no free will and felt compelled to do things as though someone (the viewer) was controlling him - well, it brings a smile the first time, but later, feels like something that perhaps a smoked-up teen would find mind boggling.

The surrounding characters are equally as shallow. They are uninteresting and static. I suppose this is all in service of the obvious gimmick at play here - it's hard to create an in depth story when it's essentially a stripped down adventure game.
From the first ten minutes, before the decisions became significant at all, it was incredibly clear what the eventual outcome of the plot would be. Black Mirror is often intentionally on the nose to prove a point, but usually it manages to pull it off with a strong narrative and interesting characters. This has neither, and as a result the message behind the scenes feels clunky and mismanaged. This episode shows it's hand right out of the gate, self referencing everything fans of Black Mirror will recognize. It does so with the subtlety of a wrecking ball through a home.
The constant stops and resets of the plot drained any interest I had in the possibility of discovering multiple story paths. Just when I was starting to get engaged in the story everything would grind to a halt and remind me that I'm watching an interactive video and not a world I can fully immerse myself in.

So when I heard less than a week ago that Netflix was releasing a new full-length movie installment into the Black Mirror universe on December 28th, I gasped, ""It's a Christmas miracle!""<br/><br/>And when I learned that this new movie, set in 1984 and centered on a young video game designer writing the code for a new video game called Bandersnatch, would immerse the audience in the story by allowing each viewer to choose how the story unfolds for them, I was cautiously optimistic. After all, The Cave of Time was one of my favorite books as a child. Indeed, for a couple of years in the early 1980s I lived on a steady literary diet of Choose Your Own Adventure books (here is a great boxed set for your favorite 9-12 year olds ... or nostalgic forty-somethings).<br/><br/>So last night, I sat down to watch (is that the right word?) Bandersnatch.<br/><br/>The choices begin early on when we are asked to choose which cereal our hero, Stefan, will have for breakfast. Fortunately, from there the choices increase in gravitas as the program unfolds.<br/><br/>One thing is clear: Bandersnatch is essential viewing for anyone remotely interested in Black Mirror ... or anyone with a Netflix account and an hour or two to spare. (Depending on your choices the program varies significantly in length.)<br/><br/>But here's my major frustration: if the show doesn't like your choice, it eventually steers you back to the main storyline. Personally, it felt a bit like getting your knuckles rapped and as the story begins to unfold again, you realize that you have rather less control than you'd been led to believe. After about 1 1/2 hours, I found myself growing increasingly impatient. Along the way, I'd been offered a couple of opportunities to bow out to the end credits, but I wanted to persist to the real end. However, eventually, I realized that my interest in completing this dark story had been outweighed by my desire to do something else, and so finally I bowed out.<br/><br/>It was at that point that I thought back to the video game Dragon's Lair. When it came to the arcade in 1983, we were dazzled by the animation.<br/><br/>But soon, the novelty wore off as we, or at least I, realized the playability was low. Put simply, there wasn't much fun in learning how to link a series of animation sequences and calling it a game.<br/><br/>For all its innovation, I have the same feeling about Bandersnatch.

After the bad taste of the loops goes away, I will try to re-watch this film without the interactive portions (available only via my computers web browser and mouse clicks) and see it thru my Fire Stick (oddly, interactive options not available) to see what Charlie Brooker decided this story should simply be. Aside from the interactive portions, directing was on point and the acting adequate. Clearly I wont be commenting on the editing lol. Shocked at all the fake high reviews, it really kills the brand when it has to come to that. A 6/10 from me, mainly for Netflix's ingenuity.</div>]",9495224

It is entertaining, and given the topic of the film, it makes perfect sense for it to be in a ""choose-your-adventure"" format, but this kind of format could potentially destroy the artistic value of cinema, if used in other contexts.<br/><br/>The themes of the story rely around the concept of free will, no matter which choices the viewer makes, hence the format makes complete sense.

Technically speaking, the film can't be touched, it's definitely well done.<br/><br/>I played around with the possible choices, and reached 5 or 6 possible endings.
There are indeed 5 hours of footage, I presume mostly repetitive though, given my experience. Many choices for example lead to similar or same results. The viewer is also challenged in the end to get back to previous choices. Some early choices bring to loose ends, and you are forced to go back in the story. Honestly, two outcomes were completely idiotic, definitely put there for the only purpose of increasing the amount of choices.<br/><br/>As I said earlier, this format works for this particular work, but the success this black mirror 'event' might reach can lead to something I personally don't want to see in cinema.
It's like turning cinema in a videogame. Technically speaking, Bandersnatch is exactly the choose-your-adventure videogame the protagonist is developing in the plot (which is another reason why this format works for this particular project).<br/><br/>I can't see anything good in mainstream cinema adopting this format for future films. Cinema is a 'passive' form of art; a work that requires the active attention of the viewer in understanding the meaning of the film he's watching, but that doesn't require his active participation.

Why should I make one or the other decision?
During the visualization of the footage, I have never been sure why I should choose one or the other option.
What does it affect?
What do I risk deciding one or the other option?
Bandersnatch never gives us options based on the argument or experiences we have had, which makes us unable to know why we have to make the decisions that it proposes.<br/><br/>Feedback:
What are the consequences of what I have done?
Has it served anything?
Has it been a false decision?
As much as the result of these elections shows us a set of specific sequences or flashbacks, we are not having a real impact on what happens throughout the footage. Things happen, but they may or may not be because of our decisions. We have no voice or real vote in what happens, since in most options we are pushed back to choose again.<br/><br/>Bandersnatch is telling us: you have chosen something without knowing why, that does not influence anything.

There wasnt really anything new here, Black Mirrors has always tried to incorporate popular contemporary scientific theory and technology into its stories and you can almost hear a cohort of fresh computer design graduates brain storming in the background trying to decide the next plot twist.
Just like in a game there has to be a narrative structure, its just when you look into it the options are very limited with modern computer capacity anyhow.
Many will vouch for GTA games series as best example of Freedom of Choice, and it certainly simulates a reality far better than this attempt. Theres Rhizome narrative models, barrel models... and the list goes on and on, but just like real life I guess they are limited and not suitable for the passive experience of sitting watching a movie.

1. Too much pointless interactivity e.g. Sugar Puffs or Cornflakes. Another example was: throw tea on computer, or break computer. Ultimately, they're both getting you to destroy the computer. I think the aim of the episode was to make you realise that you don't actually have much control (that was my understanding), but given that this is an interactive episode I think they should have given that concept more thought. At times, I felt that the interactivity ruined the flow, and would have preferred if the story was played out how the writer wanted it to be.
2. The actual story was boring, so I didn't feel a connection to the main character; and then in turn did not particularly care about the outcome. I was just selecting the more interesting options.

Just to see those alternative versions. I have to watch it all over again. Which i plan to do with my room mate in a couple of days.
I cant count on one hand the amount of films that would bring me back for a second viewing so fast.
It's not a high budget affair, the story alone appears quite simple. Its the interactive nature that gives it about 5 different levels of depth, which you can take it or leave it being the viewer. Either see it as a young man losing touch with reality. Or not to spoil anything, but a guy discovering reality isnt what it appears to be, to anyone.

If you are not a fan of English made for TV films ( and i am getting a little jaded by them) then that is the 1st hurdle to get over, familiar faces, familiar acting styles, etc, then the blatant nods at the 1980s , The Thompson Twins, Now 2 albums, the smoking on buses at the breakfast table and inside offices are all a bit obvious ( but only because they are so strange to see nowadays? im not sure.)
Then the 1st few choices are a bit naff ( especially if you have to redo them) but from then on the choices you make change your pathways, People who are saying they feel forced into a certain path, yes there are pathways you have to go to complete the show but ..come on .. give it a break, you need a bit of direction or it wont work, that said I watched it twice and got different endings each time, and I 'died' or found a dead end a few times, but some of them are trippy, some a shock, some expected.. then my wife watched it and it was like watching a different film.

I felt no remorse or sympathy towards Stefan, if it weren't for the audience's control he would remain a goody two-shoes.

As for the rest of the characters they were also quite uninteresting , except for Colin but that's because I like his style and the general vibe he's giving off.<br/><br/>Bandersnatch follows the exact same plot of ""Whirlpool"", the 68th episode of 90'ies horror anthology show ""Tales from the Crypt"" and that series did a better job at executing such a story.<br/><br/>TLDR: Bandersnatch is a boring mixture of ""Groundhog Day"" and the ""Matrix"".

Based on the choose your own adventure theory, the movie has multiple paths that are directed by the viewer. However, the film producers failed from the outset to choose a main character that actually leads any semblance of an adventurous life.
The protagonist is a video game coder in the 80's. He works alone, in his bedroom, only occasionally leaving to see a therapist. Many of the choices in the movie are incredibly mundane, like what cereal should he eat or should he talk to this person or that person.
As the movie progresses, I found myself really just dreading the next choice moment, and wishing the writers had focused on just writing a compelling story, which in my opinion they neglected to do at the expense of the contrived choices.
Towards the end, the story branches off in very different directions, some attempting to tie it into a modern day context. Again, these various endings all seem very outrageous and unresolved and feel like what a writer might throw away while developing the final script for a film. Frankly, I don't really want to see them. It's called editing.
Ultimately, I wouldn't recommend this film and wouldn't ever want to watch it again. It wasn't the worst piece of film making I've ever seen, but I sure hope isn't a sign of things to come. I'm just left wondering why, but not in a thought provoking way, but in a why bother way.</div>]",9495224

Alas, the potential isn't fully realized and it turns into a poor man's choose your own adventure that makes the old laser disc games like Dragon Age or Space Ace look nuanced by comparison.<br/><br/>There are a few factors to blame here:<br/><br/>First, the story isn't deep or weird enough that exploring the different paths feels particularly compelling or rewarding. Ironically one of the more interesting paths comes as a result of a character questioning why the protagonist's story isn't more exciting.<br/><br/>Secondly, the choices are limited and don't supply much divergence of results. In fact some of the choices (e.g. what cereal do you want to eat) seem like they're reinforcing the point that your choices really don't matter. The diverging paths lead you into small digressions you'll likely end up revisiting multiple times (with the same choices over and over) so the novelty wears off pretty quickly. If told linearly the story itself would be pretty short. Yes, there are a few minor things that will change on subsequent loops, but nothing particularly revelatory or thought-provoking.<br/><br/>Lastly, none of the endings, except for maybe one, are really that satisfying.

And I was a completionist; I would go back to every decision I made/retracting my steps and explore all possibilities until every page was read (just like in this movie.) Additionally, I programmed games and software when I was a teen in the 80s. Further, I played games all the time as shown in this feature. So this movie...was 100% me!! Well, except for the whole psycho extras.<br/><br/>Black Mirror: Bandersnatch is right up my alley. I wouldn't have ever heard of it if not for one of my favorite Podcast/YouTube Channels: Dead Meat. They covered this movie and before I let them spoil anything, I started it up in Netflix. And this ""90 minute"" movie started about 3 or so hours ago. Plan ahead.<br/><br/>Basically, you control a few key decisions for a young male in the mid-80s to create a video game based on a Choose Your Own Adventure-type novel he found in his deceased mother's belongings. Apparently, this kid is the future as he's courted by a software company.<br/><br/>Over the next three hours (at least, that's how long I ""played,"") you'll guide him in decisions to uncover his angst of finishing his video game programming.<br/><br/>Sure, people play Xbox and PlayStation games all the time where you choose your own adventure. I don't personally (or even own a console) so, it's kinda nice that Netflix set this up for me to play a movie.<br/><br/>I am not even sure if I finished this experiment or movie. I eventually made it to the credits (twice! With two endings, at least for me) without requesting to leap to the credits. I kept making decisions that they guided me to make to finally get the answers.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this ""experience"" or movie on Netflix. Especially for those who grew up in the 80s playing basic games and programmed their own, like I did. On a Coco2 or Coco3.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Final thoughts: And if you know what a Coco2 or Coco3 are, you are my new best friend.</div>]",9495224

In that sense, the movie is very trail-blazing. But as a movie, it wasn't astounding.

89745032,6 January 2019,"[<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">So I watched this film, because of it being something I had never experienced before, an interactive film, so I was intrigued and excited to see what Bandersnatch had to deliver.<br/><br/>And in all honestly I was just not that impressed by it and here's why:
My main concern with this is that it felt like a poorly made video game and not a film. I found myself not immersing in the plot of the film as I was too bothered trying to get the ""good"" ending. Which leads to my other main problem, which was that when you picked the ""wrong"" option you simply watched a scene or 2 then got taken back to the option screen again to choose the other one. So, you don't really choose your path at all. Another problem I had was that the actual plot of this film wasn't captivating. It never really gets going and I found myself choosing the daft options available just to liven it up. I typically, as well, just started waiting for the next set of options to appear which hindered the plot. Finally, the characters just aren't likable whatsoever. You do not find yourself relating to any of them and their overall mannerisms on all characters are just frustrating and annoying.<br/><br/>I have given this a 5/10, because this is something that is a brand new idea and has clearly got the attention of a lot of people. It's not a horrendous watch and a lot of people will find this idea interesting and different. However, if that is the case you may as well play an actual video game like Detroit: Become Human which is the same concept yet hours longer and done a lot better.<br/><br/>I definitely say that you should give it a go if you are interested in how it's all done. Just do not expect a film with a captivating plot with likable characters.</div>]",9495224

The big difference for me about Bandersnatch is except that it is very apocalyptic about the near future of interactive entertainement, it managed to combine it with the past and that made the movie even more personal!
I remember as kids we used to play these very first versions of interactive games. We were not trying to convince ourselfes that we were actually making the decision for the character, but we were looking at it as a riddle that we were teying to solve, but I am sure that whoever played these games, wondered at keast once in his life if the chatacter in the game knew it! That is the mindblowing thing about Bandersnatch! We have actually lived it at its babysteps and this the technology is so advance now that you might confuse what is a game and what is reality. And how far can it go? Are we in a game? U think all the 80s geeks will find Bandsnatch very exciting as it touches very personal memories of their childhood but also foreseing very exciting but also frightening future.

Instead of giving a question and then opinion about the philosophy, Bandersnatch clearly state out its opinion and spend the rest of the time trying to glue the idea to the audience. This is completely misleading to be represented as a Black Mirror episode, since the movie spits out its opinion on a controversial idea, not raising an agreed but unexplored and disturbing problem. OK, it's a nice experience about fate and free will, but we already have Romeo and Juliet and tons of movies that tackled this idea.<br/><br/>The context and concepts in Bandersnatch wasn't executed in a good way either.

I found myself caring more for each individual scene than I had for any movie prior. This all helps to heighten the story, as I found the funny scenes funnier and melodramatic scenes all the more hard hitting than they would have been without the interaction. Another added aspect is that it's just simply fun to have control. It began to encompass the allure of video games as I watched (and played!), finding myself on the edge of my seat with each decision.<br/><br/>Now for the actual movie which I found to be great, kind of. The pace throughout was excellent, with the loud/over-the-top and quiet character building moments to be perfectly built up to, while at the same time managing to co-exist simultaneously. I also found the cinematography, although a bit more restrained than show, to be extremely well shot. In many moments the filmmaking was extremely close to the main character, as it felt like the camera was studying him the most personal of ways. I also found the way it visualized repetition to be extremely interesting. It's communicated fast so we get the gist, and yet in many moments, especially when dealing with the trauma of a certain past event, it lingers as it communicates more and more detail throughout.<br/><br/>There are a few disappointing aspects however. There's the dialogue which, although certainly isn't bad, didn't hold to the normal standards of Black Mirror. It's definitely competent, but it all just felt very restrained especially when dealing with such situations. I never actually found what the characters were saying to be that interesting, and it all seemed to lack the ability to create tension as much as it was trying to. I also found the escalation of the story, with the exemption of a very clever 4th wall breaking scene, to be rather dull. Not that it needed an especially messed up moment that most episodes possess, but I felt that with this story it could have definitely gone farther.<br/><br/>There is another flaw, but even as I write this now I'm debating whether it was one or not. I'll start with an aspect that I loved and that was how personal this movie became. It perfectly internalized the mental decline of the main character, along with garnering sympathy through his traumatic past. However, I find this to be more of a testament to the movie's interactive abilities, because quite honestly the main character is not that interesting. Besides his ability to exemplify sympathy, I never necessarily found him to be that likable. He's incredibly reserved, rarely showing glimpses of personality. And maybe it's because I knew that I could always start again, but I never actually felt remorse when he was in danger or something terrible happened to him. And yet despite this I'm still hesitant on claiming that this is something wrong with the movie. Yes, the character is somewhat dull, but would this movie have actually benefited from a strong minded and completely unique individual? That approach, although may have worked, may also have created an alienation between us and the character. Maybe the current character is the best they could have had for a story like this. He's easy to get along with (which is vital, especially when considering the fact that you're basically put in his place), and because so little is actually revealed it's easy to understand him making contrasting decisions. In a sense the character acts like a blank template, as you insert pieces of yourself into him. These are all vital characteristics for a main character, when creating a story that truly is a ""chose your own adventure"".<br/><br/>In conclusion, despite a couple of disappointing aspects I still absolutely loved this movie! Netflix was the perfect platform for an idea like this to be implemented and I find this all to be a huge innovation for the film industry. I eagerly await to see more of it in the future, whether it be for a Romance, Horror, Comedy, Sci-Fi, or any other genre they may decide to try next.</div>]",9495224

13807290,25 February 2019,"[<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">Netflix receives a lot of backlash for a lot of the uninspired moves it's made the last couple of years, but the all time low was me having to sit through this.
I've played almost all of the Telltale Games and they also received a lot of scrutiny for not being exactly ""free will"" and ""tailored by choice"" etc. etc.
So Telltale at the end of their run went bankrupt. They obviously had a lot of financial issues and questionable policies, but to me the stories in those games were amazing and did not rely on their simple mechanic of choosing a path for the characters or a line they could say, this was just something you can do while the story unfolds.
Games have done this from Monkey Island to Heavy Rain and they really make an impact on the player's psyche as he shuffles through an original story. To me, a bunch of Telltale games had the same effect, such as The Wolf Among Us, the Batman series, The Walking Dead series, Borderlands, even Game Of Thrones (a TV show I hate, mind you)...
They had a great run and they went bankrupt. So what does Netflix do? Decides to use their key feature as the only plot device in a Black Mirror episode. A boring one. Some of the actors were okay, others I think were directed to act as a self-aware kind of thing which is often the case with a lot of big titles after Deadpool came out. It had this conspiracy vibe I don't really buy, it has the most insufferable Groundhog Day wannabe atmosphere and the most terrible pacing you can imagine. Also it seems that the entire cast is inadequate in playing these scenes out, since they too are not really sure if the plot is going anywhere which annoyed the hell out of me, because the episode makes you rewatch all of your decisions as if either you're some sort of inbred who can't keep up with the story or they're just as confused as you about where it's all going.
For a person who grew up with gamebooks, Bandersnatch felt anything BUT relatable. It had a really cool concept that relied way too much on this gameplay mechanic, it was unoriginal, it was bland, it had no character development, none of the stories have a closure, it had lazy writing, it had loose ends, it was just bad. And it's okay if it's bad. But it was the worst type of bad - that type of bad that really tries to convince you it's good. It's a scam. That's why I'm giving it 1. I would've given it 5 stars if it didn't felt like a gimmick.

I found myself choosing the wrong option several times throughout and had to ''go back'' rewatching some of the previous scenes, just to end up choosing again, this time the thrill was taken out of it completely, since i knew which is the ''correct'' asnwer. Basically, you end up going through like 7 alternate endings with each one trying to look more complex, but in my opinion failing quite miserably, since i didn't find this hard to follow at all, obviously more aimed at younger audiences.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie is quite blunt to put it simply, none of the alternative endings and choices were fun at all.

Ideally you could make distinct decisions and see how your fate is altered and influenced by your decisions and priorities. The use of our decision making in the meta humor (especially the hilarious Netflix path) was well done, and it allowed for some deeper, if heavy-handed, contemplation of free will and control. There are some scenes where I feel my perspective shift and am pushed to think deeper about the nature of Stefan's reality, but also some that feel cheap and cast doubt on the relevance or meaning of any past paths. It's a good idea with some excellent scenes, but not fully coherent as a full work, especially as you are taken back through the paths with little explanation or separation of realities.

52622160,4 February 2019,"[<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">""Bandersnatch"" is difficult episode of Netflix' ""Black Mirror"" to review - it isn't really an ""episode"" or a ""movie;"" it's more of an interactive online game that is reminiscent of the ""Choose-Your-Own Adventure"" young-adult books of the 1980's. (I believe they are actually name-checked in ""Bandersnatch's"" main narrative, before it branches off into multiple stories.) This main narrative follows a troubled young computer programmer (expertly played by Fionn Whitehead) as he begins to question his own reality while struggling with demons from his past.<br/><br/>From there, ""Bandersnatch"" unfolds according to the viewer's choices. (Netflix has configured the episode so that viewers control the protagonist simply by clicking options with their computer's cursor.) The meta-fictional twist here is that Whitehead's protagonist is himself developing a groundbreaking multiple-choice style video game for his employer. (The episode is set in 1984, when interactive games had not yet developed alongside arcade-style games.) What follows is a seemingly indeterminate number of stories, with ""Black Mirror's"" predictably disturbing surprises.<br/><br/>I've read that there are four ""main endings"" at which the show's writer, Charlie Brooker, thinks most viewers will arrive. There are supposedly a great number of other endings, as well - and the viewer can reverse the course of a narrative and follow a different path. It's all interesting stuff, even if it's a little complicated.<br/><br/>So I'm not sure how to review it. And I'm not sure I'm the best guy to offer such an opinion, as I am not the target audience for an experiment like this. I've always been a ""movie guy,"" and not a ""video game guy"" - I'm the kind of milquetoast man that would rather be passively entertained by a story than involved, in real-time, in its creation. I want a cohesive story with a clear denoument that was intended by the writer and director - not a mongrelized story that I came up with myself. (Yes, I know that makes me sound the opposite of cool and fun and adventurous, but I'm just being honest here.) I trust ""Black Mirror"" to knock my socks off with it's storytelling - Brooker is a goddam genius, and this show is nothing less than the 21st Century's ""Twilight Zone.<br/><br/>I certainly liked ""Bandersnatch."" A key expository sequence in the first pathway I selected made me smile and laugh (due to the show's intended black humor, of course). I'd rate this viewing experience an 8 out of 10, for the fun I had with it.<br/><br/>But I do hope this is the only episode of its kind. There are disadvantages that this experimental format probably cannot escape. Pacing, plot structure and story cohesion all typically go right out the window after ""rewinding"" and story options are introduced. This lacked the cinematic quality that is characteristic of ""Black Mirror"" episodes, and ultimately felt like a video game. I also had the compulsion, upon completing my first story arc, to return to the action and find an ending that was ""correct"" or possibly better. And when my next narrative meandered, I wondered whether I was ""doing it right.""<br/><br/>I had another quibble too, and it's admittedly a strange one. Many elements of ""Bandersnatch's"" 1980's setting here are garish, bizarre or unpleasant. (Some of the characters - particularly the father - were so off-putting that they made revisiting a story sequence almost irritating.) I suppose that this was probably a deliberate choice by Brooker and by episode director David Slade - possibly to capture the vibe of the Philip K. Dick stories that are this episode's obvious inspiration.<br/><br/>But I don't think it was necessary to the plot. Consider how different a story like this might be if it were filmed with the starkly beautiful visuals of the 2017 ""Crocodile"" episode directed by John Hillcoat.<br/><br/>Postscript - there was one metafictional twist that only I could enjoy. And that's a shame, because it was pretty neat. When Will Poulter's character here tells Whitehead's that they've ""met before,"" that struck a chord with me personally - because Poulter, who has blond hair here, looks a lot like an old pal of mine from college.

38340845,28 January 2019,"[<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">Idea behind interactive movie seems crazy right? Netflix decided to put it to good use and give us the first interactive movie with choice of taking your own path while watching a movie. They get a great deal of points for that but we need to be realistic about all this, they said it was a 5 hours of movie filmed and put together in various ways that you will be able to move around. All that seems groundbreaking, heartwarming, exciting but there is always a but and now you will find out something that might disappoint you.
Writing a movie like this is very hard that must be said and if you really want to make this you need to put director that is capable of providing a point of view that will actors get and understand.
To be fair it is quite a movie, but it never fully delivers you feeling like you are in control, know what I mean? It often offers you path that has an end and brings you back to cross point and offers you choices again so you are forced to take some path. You all might not think that is something that would bother you, after that happens more than once you will be angry.
They made an interesting story and got a whole lot of things to be working as a solid machine but all imperfections of movie will bug you because after all it is called Choose-your-own-adventure movie but it doesn't offer you path for some actions instead brings you back.
Looking back at movie now you could possibly finish whole movie within 60 minutes of watching which will be too short to attach to characters and really giver you chance to connect with their actions.
Story that follows our main character is great there is no doubt about that but with some changes it might have been one of the best movies that you could watch thanks to interaction and your desire to do something that maybe character wouldn't usually do or have done.
It will be pretty exciting to see next movie that will feature your interaction on this levels with choosing a path of story.
Now the thing that you will love is some of the decisions that you have to make. There are couple of scenes when you are forced to choose path and either decision is pretty terrifying and depending on how you feel you are going to choose that.
Finally it would be pretty amazing if we could have a movie that we can only watch once with certain path that we took, that would make some difference than this way when we can chose and repeat and go back because if we are forced to make decision that will be permanent it would have greater impact on what you choose. 3/4</div>]",9495224

At some points you will probably feel like you just want to sit back and enjoy the film. Admittedly, viewers can refrain from making choices that the film prompts them to choose from and let it ride out itself but then what is the point of watching this type of film right? It's understandable that the filmmakers want to address the feeling of 'what if' which often occurs when we watch films with undesirable, or open endings, and then build on that. But debating and fantasizing is almost an integral part of post film-watching and it is one of the things that makes classic films classic. Sometimes, a time worthy film is a film that doesn't have a finish.<br/><br/>If you are like me, who consider watching films as a laid-back leisure activity then it's easy to grow tired of this flick and you will likely find yourself crawling back to some good old film-makings. However, as there are definitely more to be delved into and Bandersnatch was prospectively experimental, it is no doubt that there is greatness to come for this genre.

32106619,18 January 2019,"[<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">It's interesting to speculate how things might have turned out differently. In late December 2011, British television aired a new show called Black Mirror. The publicity promised something dark, possibly comic, with a plot revolving around a pig. It was to be an anthology series - meaning that each episode was unconnected (narratively speaking) to others. When episode one aired, what unfolded was a story about a British Prime Minister blackmailed in to a sex act with a pig which was to be broadcast live on television, in order to save a popular member of the Royal Family who had been kidnapped. It's had to watch, simultaneously horrifying and funny with a plot twist in the conclusion. The series gained some traction, and two short seasons were made. Then, in 2015, a story broke about real life British Prime Minister David Cameron allegedly doing something similar involving a pig's head at university - and though there's little in the way to establish the truth of the story, Black Mirror's prophetic legend was established. Netflix picked up the series, and now it's a genuine cultural force; it's become something of a tired cliché to wearily sigh that a news story is 'like something out of Black Mirror'; but the tiredness of the cliché doesn't stop people saying it, of course.<br/><br/>So it was that a one-off new, 90 minute episode of the show arrived on Netflix over Christmas. Black Mirror: Bandersnatch has its own unique hook; it's an interactive film. Throughout the narrative, the viewer is invited to choose one of two courses of action by clicking the trackpad. Technically it's brilliant; there's only occasionally a slightly discernible jump in the edit when the choice is made, and buffering never rears its head. The plot itself is, well, somewhat meta: it's set in the mid-1980s. A young man is writing a computer game called Bandersnatch, based on an epic Choose Your Own Adventure book of the same name, a book which drove its author into dark, paranoid places. This being Black Mirror, the narrative doesn't stint on shock value. Initially the choices the viewer is presented with seem insignificant - what sort of breakfast cereal should he eat?; what music should he listen to?. By the time the central character starts holding a conversation with you and directly posing the viewer a question, you're in a much stranger, more ostensibly troubling place.<br/><br/>The performances are all fine; though slightly hindered by the format - it's hard, after all, to act a scene when you don't know how the scene is going to conclude. But that's a small gripe, which the viewer learns to let slide; by the time you reach one of the five or so main endings, you're given the choice of exiting to the credits or returning to certain points in the story to try again. It's addictive, fun, and has obvious rewatch value. For me, though, despite its many strengths, it left me cold. Yes it's fun; yes, I even tried to place myself in the narrative (by choosing my own favourite cereal or music or even express mental health issues the way I do in real life), but I still felt strangely distanced from it. This isn't a unique problem for Black Mirror; for all the show's cleverness, capacity to shock and undeniable entertainment value, it's one of those shows that tries hard to be about something without actually having much to say about the thing it's about. That thing often happens to be free will and/or the effect of technology on the user - but too often interesting ideas are left dangling like that wire behind the television that doesn't seem to go anywhere. Writer Charlie Brooker rarely seems able to make a coherent blend out of big themes and the desire to shock or horrify; the results are too often a stone-in-the-shoe sort of lack of satisfaction, for all the cleverness and gripping material that has gone before.<br/><br/>When it comes to the big question of free will, with which this episode is so clearly concerned, there is much that could have been said that wasn't. Free will has always been a thorny issue for the Christian; are we puppets on God's strings, and if so, is He kind or cruel? Do we have the capacity to say no to God? What does 'predestined' mean? Poles of interpretation - as in so many areas - are rarely satisfying or logically coherent. To take the one view, God orders and wills and causes everything - in which case it's almost a logical impossibility to see Him as good; and you end with such a delicately constructed theological system that if one part is troubled, the whole edifice shakes and threatens to fall apart. Surely God's more intellectually secure than that? The other pole is to suggest that either we're in charge of everything - which might explain the messes we're always in, but rather makes a mockery of God's wisdom and our need of Him at all; or He doesn't know and can't foresee everything. Which is certainly interesting, but makes him somewhat hard to trust.<br/><br/>There are moments in Bandersnatch when the central character is railing at whoever is controlling him, asking for a sign, questioning the choices he's presented with and wrestling with the situations in which he finds himself. In that sense, he reminds me of Job; but unlike Job, the man at the heart of Bandersnatch can hardly be called blameless. What we can't criticise him for - because God doesn't rebuke Job for it either - is his raging or questioning. God seems to positively encourage that. The issue is what we do it when the raging is done; Bandersnatch offers few answers because the writer doesn't seem able to - and as viewers, picking one of two options, we make for awfully limited gods. Ultimately this may lead to a new kind of visual storytelling; or it may go the way of Betamax video. Who can say yet what the divine storyteller has in mind for interactive film-making?<br/><br/>In the endings I came to in the film, the central character never seems to find peace; every ending leads to question, a self-doubt, a cause for anger or fear or guilt. That's not how Job ends; at the end of Job's questioning, he's met with few answers. He's not rebuked for asking them, but he is asked by God to accept his place, to learn who's God and who's man, and to understand that there are limits to his understandings. It's not wrong to want to know why things are happening; but he must accept that in the end he will not know - other than that he is known by the one who knows.<br/><br/>Bandersnatch is, for now, an example of a young art form, testing technology to see where it will bend or break; there may yet be much to come from this format, or there may not. But for now the choices it offers remain strictly binary; even that can send us down potentially mind-bending roads of multiple possibilities which soon fracture under our limited capacities. When we create, we create out of what already exists, with limited possibilities and conclusions available to us; even that is too . The God who invites our questions is big enough to hold our questions and allow us peace in both the asking and the lack of answering. There's courage in our asking and freedom to be embraced in our unknowing; our divine storyteller comes to se us free, not to control, manipulate and abuse. Bandersnatch gives us a fun, pale imitation of our futile and cruel capacity to play at being god. We'd do well to address our questions to a better writer.</div>]",9495224

97593442,10 January 2019,"[<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">I just finished watching the groundbreaking Netflix' Black Mirror episode, Bandersnatch. Bandersnatch is an interactive film to be watched on a device (ala iPhone), and it enables you to make click certain choices throughout watching, and changes the storyline based on your decision. If you grew up in the early 80's, this is like the high tech version of The Abominable Snowman and The Forbidden Castle ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" paperback books. The average viewing is 90 minutes, but it can range from 40 to 150 minutes. So while I say I finished watching it, what does that even mean?<br/><br/>Bandersnatch re-invented storytelling as we know it. Sure, I suppose it's a bit gimmick'y, but if the technology is developed thoughtfully, I think it can truly create an entirely new experience. The risk is to fall into the trap of the recent iterations of 3D and Virtual Reality, which were the latest shiny objects that haven't substantively enhanced the storytelling experience. But what I feel to be different about this interactive approach is how much more engaging and immersive it is. Not just the way it 'looks', but the way the story unfolds. It felt personal. As I made the choices, I felt like I was making 'my story', not the one that the writer or director were forcing on me. As I made my choices, I even found myself self-reflecting a bit (""wait, am I a bad person to choose the red pill???""). The only concern here is a potential privacy issue, where Netflix may be gathering quite a bit of data on my decision making. But that's a whole different story.<br/><br/>In addition to this fascinating new TV tech, I love that it was the Black Mirror series pioneering the possibilities of interactive film. I am a huge fan of Black Mirror. It is undoubtedly the heir to the Twilight Zone throne for the current era. It continues to push the boundaries of the possible, in a very dark and creepy manner. It explores just a smidge past the boundaries of today's technology, and poses brilliantly freaky 'what if' scenarios. All with top notch writing, directing and acting. The cinemography is a rare gem where you could take a snapshot from just about any scene- and frame it on the wall as art. The scores and soundtracks are timely, lush and eery at all the right moments. The Thompson Twins, Frankie Goes to Hollywood and Kajagoogoo all setting the scene for Bandersnatch's 1984 era storyline. Brilliant.<br/><br/>I thought it would be worth mentioning that I just finished watching most of this year's Best Picture contenders for this year's Oscars, and while a few of them had some merit, I have to say that TV series' like this Black Mirror episode take the cake. Look at some of the current TV and streaming series, and they're clearly doing a much finer job than today's movies. It's often said that the smaller budget, art house movies of the 70's, 80's and 90's are a thing of the past. The movie studios are no longer financing what were great movies, and from what I can see- it looks like TV has taken over where they left off. And when you add this kind of groundbreaking technology to superior writing and directing- movies are sadly getting left in the dust.<br/><br/>So I certainly recommend the latest Black Mirror interactive film, Bandersnatch. And I look forward to seeing how Black Mirror, Netflix and the future TV and movie industries take full advantage of this fascinating new way of telling an old fashioned, good story.</div>]",9495224

The temporal loops and self-consistency feel just on the edge of what the brain can construct which makes it feel huge whilst being understandable. Sadly for me Bandersnatch did not come close to this. Instead we have a very narrow and derivative piece of work that fails to achieve anything it set out to.<br/><br/>My first ending - which I imagine is most people's given that it was the obvious choice - sets up the stage well enough. But like the critical review of the game, the ending was short and abrupt and really foreshadowed what the film failed with. It almost felt like a 2nd level meta. Yes Stefan may have been controlled by me, but I was just being controlled by the writer of the film. But instead of making me feel empathy with the character it just made the whole thing self defeating.<br/><br/>Self-referential can work. The computer game The Talos Principle is an excellent example of this. You are an AI that has been iterated to the point where you are thought to be a good approximation for a human, and then tested to see if you would do human like actions. Of course your character is able to pass the human-quality tests because you the player are a human. You cannot help but to be seen as human. Everything fits.<br/><br/>A better example of how this can be done again comes from the gaming world - The Stanley Parable. If I were to summarise this film in one sentence it would be to say that it is a badly-made unfunny Stanley Parable. Where the computer game succeeds into inviting you to explore the world, teasing you to either conform or defy as it takes you into madness, this film just snoozes you from one decision to the next. Indeed the only thing funny about Bandersnatch is the Bandersnatch itself.<br/><br/>Also not making a choice didn't work either. It could have - giving far more control back to Stefan by not playing. Indeed it could have been possible to play a fine line where he is in control of most actions because you don't pick before jumping in at key ones. But so many of the paths stop so soon afterwards that this is never implemented in a satisfying way. Indeed the production values were so bad at the choosing points that you felt jarred - did the post-choice scene always have to start with the two options in front?<br/><br/>Overall this is worse than the choose your own adventure books or the early choose your own adventure video-graphic games.

Some choices that you will be required to make are minor and others are huge, which as mentioned can change the entire experience or the plot! So choose carefully.<br/><br/>Because this is not a normal film, my review score will be based on my experience of this new concept from Netflix and not the film itself. After long consideration I feel it's basically impossible to review this as a standard film. Since watching the film I have also talked with other viewers and discussed their experience of the film. Overall, I am rather surprised to hear people's different results and what story others were able to achieve.<br/><br/>According to IMDb, the total amount of footage that was used to make this film is a total of 5 hours and 12 mins. All of this footage can also be viewed by the Netflix viewer, but to do this, it would require you watch the film multiple times. On average, a viewer watching this movie would only watch approx. 90 mins of footage until you would need to start the film all over again to get a different ending.<br/><br/>As a personal experience, I watched this on the night of its release on Netflix along with my wife. The film and world that is created in the Black Mirror series is incredible. As selections were made, I was also surprised as to just how smoothly everything runs, flowing just like a normal film. There are no loading screens or delays when selections are required to be made. Even if you're thinking about your choice, the film still continues on as it awaits your final decision. I can say that I have witnessed this type of concept before with selected PlayStation 4 video games, but even then I've never seen or experienced anything as smooth as this in regards to both loading times and its pace. Most games I have experienced also have actors that are rather cheesy where this film has invested into getting proper, talented actors. As for the plot, it's unique and I feel many people will relate to the film, not to mention that I personally loved the 80s references thoughout the film too.<br/><br/>As an experience though, it was a tad tricky. As I stated, the journey I was rather exciting, but around the half way mark, sections of the film began to be repeated so I could choose a path that led to a final ending. Some of the time I was happy to revisit the choice, but at other times I did find it slightly annoying. Once again, this will depend on the user and the selections you made. Out of the 5 endings I have successfully completed 3 different endings thus far...<br/><br/>Overall, Netflix has supported a new film which I feel will be game changer when it comes to movies. If you haven't watched this film, I totally recommend it as I feel it would surprise many of its audiences and you will find a good dose of entertainment as it is new and fresh (and fun!). Every person who watches this film will experience something different to others. Could this be a new fad? Imagine selecting outcomes on the next horror film. Like 3D, this fad could have its moment and then disappear. Personally, I enjoyed this concept and I give full credit to Netflix's effort to deliver something new to the world.

The problem lies in the fact that because the story isn't overly interesting, you often don't really care enough about which decision you actually pick.<br/><br/>This was the first time I have ever watched a film like this before. It was an entirely original concept (at least in terms of film) and something that I would happily do again. It could have been done better in some ways, no doubt about it. But it also could have been done worse in some ways too it would have to be said. Even if you don't have the best time with 'Black Mirror: Bandersnatch' I think it's something you have to give a go.

The film takes place in 1984 and references to music and video games of that era, which are of high interest to me. But that wasn't what made this movie exceptional. It's the way it draws you in with excellent performances and a rare quality of storytelling letting you make choices that itself is part of the story. So far i have gone through three viewings, two with others making the choices and it's been fun everytime. Thre's still stuff i didn't get so i gotto go back and watch again.

70293131,4 January 2019,"[<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">It's impressive what Netflix have managed to achieve with Black Mirror: Bandersnatch. It's like the old popular game books for geeks in the age of pre-computers and landlines, where the reader could change the outcome of the story, following a diversity of story line crossings and loops. But now it's in a movie format, which makes it vastly more engaging and immersive.<br/><br/>Effectively the movie exists in several different parallel endings (almost like universes) and multiple inner loops, intersections and mini-plots until you reach any of them. This makes the viewer(s) actually an active part of the story, able to navigate the main character, while each small choice affects not just the main story line, but also side characters' circumstances.<br/><br/>It's a path of trial and error and exploration, which makes the viewer(s) think about the butterfly effect and most importantly, put themselves in the shoes of the main character and consider in a new way the available choices and their consequences. Every next decision the plot gets more and more twisted, the viewer immerses deeper into the absurdity (or maybe call it darkness) of the story, always wondering ""did I make the right choice"".<br/><br/>The story itself, even though not super exciting at the surface, concerns many deep psychological topics and issues about the individual and the society, about entertainment vs cruelty, real vs fake, life, etc. The irony is that the actual story revolves around the development of an arcade PC game with multiple choices and endings, based on a game book. The movie will make us feel like we're in a recursion with our reality several times (i.e. watching about watching about navigating in a game film).<br/><br/>To sum up, for me this is complete novelty as a movie experience, I thoroughly enjoyed it each of the 5 times I watched it and I would love to see more of these.</div>]",9495224

Some of the choices seem irrelevant(choice of breakfast or music) while some of the choices largely affect the storyline. So yes, you will be in control of the character, but not much(which is good actually).
But what matters for any movie is the storyline and plot, and that's where this movie falters. Comparing to the plots of Black Mirror, Bandersnatch seems like a child's movie. But for those who have not watched any Black Mirror episodes, it can be termed mediocre. Other things such as acting and cinematography were good (like any other Netflix Original).
I watched nearly 5-6 endings out of which two were nearly identical(and dull also). Similarly a few endings seemed hilarious(seemed like a joke to me). Only one of the endings I had witnessed had a real plot to be honest. And that plot can be rated 7/10 at best.

64329699,30 December 2018,"[<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">Despite how the movie made me feel and question life itself, Black Mirror: Bandersnatch is left floating in between a poor game and a decent Black Mirror episode.<br/><br/>Reviewing Bandersnatch is a more difficult task, since people review it in different ways. Some see it as a game and some see it as a movie. In reality it should be a movie, however since it is interactive it makes Bandersnatch feel like it is neither. The interactive feature hasn't been executed well enough for this to stay as a well structured movie and instead of me choosing the character's choices I just got to see what would have happened.<br/><br/>The interactive part: I never really felt I had control at all. I had to choose wrong or right without knowing which was which and if it was wrong then I'd just be forced to go back and choose the right one. While this is great in that I can easily see different events that would occur, I should be choosing the events of the movie and what happens in it. The movie would honestly be better off without the interactions and instead the writers choosing one of the many endings. Another thing is the movie wasn't cut very well in the parts where you had to make a choice.<br/><br/>As for it being a movie, its interesting and definitely Black Mirror - but only in the sense of how it made us think. Usually Black Mirror is how a great invention can backfire. In The Entire History of You there was the memory implant, Arkangel with the tracker, you know the rest. There was no device which left the plot quite weak. The good thing was that we as viewers were basically in a Black Mirror episode. Apart from that everything else was too standard. Like said in the movie (no spoilers) everything was too normal. Cinematography had no chance to shine, acting was good but nothing spectacular. I did enjoy the music though, we even got a chance to choose which we wanted.<br/><br/>Even with the poorly executed interactive system and the too normal of a film, the fact that the viewer was really apart of a movie allowed Bandersnatch to create a fun watch for us to enjoy. The idea of an interactive movie is great. (The solution to doing it right would be that our choices are our choices just like opinions. They are not wrong or right. If another interactive movie is made I hope we get to guide the movie instead of seeing outcomes of decisions we don't want). However as a first attempt it's not a bad one and hopefully if Netflix decide to do more of these then they work better next time.</div>]",9495224

After viewing all of the endings, I have to say I'm a touch disappointed. I think the integration of giving the viewer control was done flawlessly, however, only one of the possible endings actually works in my opinion. The writing all leads to one ending that actually makes sense and provides an interesting commentary on the concept of interactive entertainment; the other four seem to only be there for the sake of having multiple endings. Although I give the creative team points for trying something this risky, I think the finished product comes off as lazy and rushed for the majority of the endings, and after viewing it once, yields diminishing returns for every subsequent viewing, even including the unseen endings.

I find most of the stories too depressing. I do think this new concept by Netflix of ""chose your own adventure"" is an interesting one and to have it done in the Black Mirror Universe intriguing. I found it to actually be too linear and too depressing. Most of the decesions either ended the movie, had no outcome, or brought you to the same general place. There were very few branches of story and very few endings.<br/><br/>That being said the story itself isn't THAT far off the Black Mirror Universe wheelhouse. It is a story about choice and if we ever really have it? Which is ironic in a chose your own adventure story. It is also a story of control and who has it over us? This episode has been compared to White Bear a couple of times and I can see how it might fit if you think about it a bit.<br/><br/>I would love to see this be done again by Netflix but for it to work it needs more choices and more outcomes and possibly even the potential for a happy ending but I guess maybe that is too much to ask for in Black Mirror.<br/><br/>That being said everyone giving this such a low rating is being overly and overtly harsh.

You thought three dimensions are cool? But let me tell you theaters are long gone. The future is right on your desk in front of your bed. And by watching this movie you're going to witness the future of storytelling.<br/><br/>When I first heard about interactive cinema, I was confused. I didn't know what to expect, but then, the story started to take shape and I was amazed. I was like, is this even real? It's a movie where I control the story. Yeah, it's an interactive film where you control the story, but don't be too excited because you actually don't.<br/><br/>One of the greatest tasks of storytelling is to build tension, and as they say 'your protagonist must decide'. In a good story, at some point the protagonist should face choices and either way the choices are good, or can be bad for the protagonist, now he/she have to make a decision that will affect the rest of the storyline. Now, that's a regular storytelling model for you, what if you can make the decisions for the protagonist? I don't know about you, but I've been in so many movies where the character is about to make a huge mistake and I'm just sitting there tight, trying to say don't do that you stupid fool. I've even seen some random dude shouting from the back 'don't f open the damn door, you fool' in some random horror movies. Now what if the character could actually listen, and take the advice? Now, it's not possible in a huge theater with hundreds of people in it cause obviously it will not work. Maybe I'll say open the door and the guy, sitting next to me will say 'don't listen to that madafaka, don't open it' and it will create a chaos and by the half time, everyone in the theater will be fighting each other instead of watching the movie. Now, that won't be a problem for Netflix because people usually watch Netflix alone or with max of two to three people, and this type of storytelling is actually brilliant. I mean, I don't know if it will be a great success with some random stories, but I like it what they did with this movie.<br/><br/>Now why this interactive storytelling is a success for Black Mirror: Bandersnatch? - Actually this movie itself is chaotic, confusing and with the help of this type of storytelling they made it more irritating and chaotic to watch. It worked great, so perfectly balanced that I don't even know if this type of storytelling is going to work in any other scenario. The main goal in a visual storytelling is to lead the audience to the climax and giving them the feelings the protagonist experienced in that story. Often after watching a great movie or series you feel changes in your personal character because of that. And in this movie, they did a great job by using this type of storytelling. They created the perfect labyrinth and you will fall for it. So, I don't know if this is the future of cinema, but I'm sure this is something.<br/><br/>Rating: 7/10.</div>]",9495224

They know that tiny choices are weak as the main character said but they still give us a bunch of them, they appear to be experts in the study of cinema, but can't mix it well with game programing to live inside the main character's mind.<br/><br/>Watching this, most probably not get you involved in it, first because the main character didn't make you like him by any means, while making decisions for him, you are not caring, so nonsense happens.<br/><br/>Another thing makes you not enjoyed, the rush in time, you have 10 seconds for each of the choices, most of which are big deals which need time for thinking and consideration!<br/><br/>The worst thing in that choices thing that you don't know anything the character knows so you can dependingly choose! The movie should start with a character who knows nothing in what he is going to experience, and both of us learn together, so my choice can be logical!<br/><br/>The movie moved in more than a path they didn't complete, more than a choice that isn't actually linked up to the story but just mentioned to prevent usefulnessless!<br/><br/>All the mind blowing stuff in the movie didn't really happen, because they couldn't make sense out of it; flashbacks, hallucinations, and dreams were always their way out.<br/><br/>Last but not least, Contol! Not because two choices appear on your screen frequently, means that you are controlling the storyline, not at all, you are only controlling a stupid character who can't control his story. Both of you are controlled by the trying-to-be-smart writer who always push you to where he wants you to go. Lack of choices, and weakness of them, make you forced to make bad choices, that ofcourse will make bad endings.<br/><br/>Anyway, the movie has good ideologies, each single part of it is perfect on its own, but that combination of choices and storylines aren't. Thr film making is impressive as Black Mirror creators made it usual, directing, cinematography, and SPECIALLY VIDEO EDITING, they are all amazing!<br/><br/>So, the movie is a good experience, far from perfection but still very exciting and good, you don't really control the storyline because both choices limitation and lack of knowledge.<br/><br/>Oh, one last thing, you would try to make the smartest choice and sometimes make a choice you don't really want; don't worry, even the writer wasn't that smart, it's not an IQ test, Netflix &amp; Chill!</div>]",9495224

92762846,30 December 2018,"[<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">Wow, what a disappointment. Bandersnatch's relentlessly meta narrative is not remotely as clever or novel as Netflix would have you believe. How people can say it is completely new when the format it coopts has long existed in books, video games, and even some movies like the 2016 title ""Late Shift"" is beyond me.<br/><br/>What Bandersnatch has going for it are some great performances, particularly by Asim Chaudhry and Will Poulter, and there are some trippy moments involving some hallucinogens and a mirror that I found well crafted (there is an Ubik easter egg which was also greatly appreciated). But that is where my praise would end. From the moment I chose to splash water on my computer instead of yelling at my father, which lead me immediately to a fail state, I understood that the Bandersnatch intent was to play on false notions of free will, giving people behind the remote the illusion of choice but really just barreling them down towards a few options to save money having to plan out for every possible contingency. It uses small input that comes in the form of choosing between two often random decisions as a red herring to present an otherwise contrived and uninteresting tale.<br/><br/>I am sure some people will mistake its faux meta intellectualism for something more than it is. But at its core Bandersnatch feels disjointed, jumping from scene to scene not letting the player soak in the consequences of their choices, and manipulative, billing itself as a choose your own adventure when it really intends to give the viewer the illusion of power over a story that was really entirely in the control of the directors. Of course directors can choose what to put on the screen but they cannot choose how the audience interprets those pictures, this is the case with all movies and is by no means a novel concept. Media is a creation, often static and lacking autonomy. Perhaps our own lives are like that, who knows it is beyond us.<br/><br/>If Bandersnatch had smoother transitions from choice to consequence, and if it had taken a more measured and subtle approach rather than bashing the meta narrative over the viewer's head, then I could have found Netflix's foray into the choose-your-own-adventure genre far more entertaining than the banal smattering of philosophical drivel that I was unfortunately given.

If you want to see all possible storylines my advice would be let it play in autoplay mode allowing default action to be chosen. And then in second iteration try to play along with opposite choices. In any way Netflix allows you to revisit the last deciding state after each ending. After sometimes you might get bored I advice let it sleep for few hours and resume. Good thing is once you have chosen a set actions at the end before credits watching you can again resume in last diverting timeline and that too in a fast replay till that moment.

Novel interactive story choice, 80s era nostalgia and video games (my generation!) plus breaking the fourth wall a la Deadpool. Except... I was bored. I'm not sure what went wrong. Part of the problem is the interactive element doesn't work in a movie. The novelty of choosing the story path wears quickly. It was a fad that was tried in the 80s in choose your own adventure books and text based video games both of which faded in popularity as computing power advanced which allowed for truly immersive 3D worlds and multiplayer interactivity. If viewers wanted interactivity they would play a modern game. If they wanted a good movie it works better the traditional way so you're not wondering how the movie should've ended. Instead Bandersnatch ends up being neither a good movie nor a good game.<br/><br/>The other problem is the story drags without much happening. The one nice touch is when the main character breaks the fourth wall and discovers he's trapped in a Netflix movie and meets the director and cast. But this wasn't enough to redeem the slow pacing and weak story. I rewatched some scenes again to see if I might enjoy it more on second viewing. I did not. But I feel the weak story is the main problem more so than the interactive element. IMO this is the weakest episode though I haven't seen them all. If you remove the interactive element and see each of the story scenarios on its own it still doesn't make a good short film because there isn't much story at all. It might be ok as a character study in delusional schizophrenia as the main character gets lost in his own mind under the pressure of game delivery deadlines but the execution is poor. Many scenes are drawn out emotive blank stares without much dialogue and what dialogue there is makes no sense. It might be enjoyable as a moody character study but it doesn't work as a story with a message. This might've worked if the story was good and the interactive element adds to the experience but instead the plot foundation is shaky and the interactive element detracts from the experience. Still it's great to see Black Mirror trying something inventive even if it falls short.</div>]",9495224

96791788,29 December 2018,"[<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">The idea of ""make your choice to continue the story"" was started in video-games and some books. In general, I hate this idea, the artist should have the decision of what he/she wants to ""say"" and the audience should has his own interpretation. We will see the same idea in the near-future in music (choose the chorus you prefer, the verse, the lyrics), digital paintings or other forms of art. But, this just spoil the meaning of art. Now that we have the technology to do it on TV, it was a matter of time to be done.<br/><br/>There is a reason that it would be a mistake to give to the audience the choice of an alternative intro for Pink Floyd's ""Shine on You Crazy Dimond"", or change the melting clocks on Dali's ""The Persistence of Memory"" with melting eggs or whatever you like, or choose the ending of Chuck Palahniuk's ""Fight Club"" etc.<br/><br/>I kinda liked the movie because the whole concept ""of make your own choice"" was in the same time part of the film's script idea. Still, I prefer ""Mr. Nobody"" over this one (compare two films about the decisions we make).<br/><br/>About plural realities and the script in general, I'm very happy that Charlie Brooker has read a lot of Philip K. Dick. Views on fate and alternate realities are clearly modeled on those of PKD. The whole movie and some episodes of the series can be seen as a directly tribute to him (Stefan's mentor at the gaming company, has a poster on his wall of PKD's 1969 novel ""Ubik""). The main difference is that PKD did not only write about shifting realities but he actually believed in them, always keep searching the ""nature of reality"" between other subjects. So, this is the main part of what we watched on this movie. A little bit of the science/paranoid/philosophical fiction of PKD.<br/><br/>The idea of ""make your choice"" failed in books and I hope it will fail in films as well. Now, we have one good movie that support this concept, so lets stop it here. Black Mirror series usually have to do with the bad side of the future technology.

It's mind-bending and thrilling to engage in this and to see the direct impact the decision we as viewers make has on the story.<br/><br/>The option to go back at the end and make different choices was a fantastic addition to the film. It added complexity but also enables viewers to see how differently the film would have ended if we had made a different choice. Even when the film had ended I found myself going back at every opportunity I was given to make a different choice and see how it impacted the events and ending. Everything is so meticulous, the attention to detail is stunning and it's not just the interactive feature, but the way the story interacts with the viewer that makes it such as truly immersive experience.<br/><br/>Like every episode of Black Mirror this film really makes you think about and question the nature of complex issues such as humanity, technology, morality, free-will and the power of choice. It leads you to wonder whether there truly is such a thing as free-will or whether everything we do is pre-determined by outside forces.<br/><br/>In my opinion, this far and above one of the best Netflix films I've ever seen and sets the standard high for any other interactive films of this kind that might follow.

The stories got deeper, more interesting and way above the competition. It has become the show to watch for everyone interested in both good, challenging sci-fi and a way to reflect on our times and the paths the technology could lead us.<br/><br/>So, the premise is very exciting to most nerds out there - a guy is a game designer from the 80s, and the setting is reminiscent of the famous ""San Junipero"" episode from Season 3. You can see that authors have a lot of love/nostalgia for the period and for the gaming industry of that time. So, the setting is great, the actors are great, now for the bad part... the plot, the syuzhet is very, very weak. It's supposed to be for the videogame geeks, but all the game geeks know that interactive movies have been tried and failed in the 90s and Bandersnatch just follows closely in that tradition.<br/><br/>First of all, your choices are not that relevant to the story, in many respects (hello Telltale games), there is a clearly preferred path to follow for a good story and ending and there are other paths thrown in for the alternate endings. It's not rewarding enough to explore all paths. This is where most of the interactive movies failed in the 90s and noughts and this is where we still are in the 2018. Interesting, how nothing changes there.<br/><br/>Second, even the main path is not that interesting and not that well written. There is no deep experience, no profound truth, no logic in the main actions of the protagonist. It all seems rehashed and the most profound idea - an LSD-induced understanding of Pac Man is just a simple, tongue in cheek joke.<br/><br/>Third, the whole experiment seems gimmicky, just like the awful Philips CD-i game console of the 90s. I think, if someone could port this to the CD-i, it will be a match made in gamer's hell.<br/><br/>So, this is severely disappointing and not on par with the other episodes in the great series.

101787569,30 September 2019,"[<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">Bandersnatch is essentially a 'choose your own adventure' game translated into a movie. The concept is not something new, we have those TellTale games and even other Netflix productions for kids had used the same presentation concept. But something as big as Bandersnatch was never attempted before.
Under the label of Black Mirror, this movie tells us the story of a young programmer who's reality falls apart as he tries to adapt a novel into a videogame. First of all, i've never watched an episode of Black Mirror, but considering this has some quality, I would say this is a great start to get into the show.
The movie is good? Yes, but it could've been better. I really dig how you can make decisions and that they influence the path the history follows, but these elemtens are not fully exploited. They could've introduced more decisions, more consecuences, more plotlines. Some people may say the experience would be more boring or more complicated, personally I don't think so, that way it would've been more satisfacory.
The message of the movie is pretty on the nose, some consecuences are quite predictable and the flow of events is not that smooth. So there's some presentation elements that are not so great, but it would be very dificult to kinda amend them.
Other than that, this movie is pretty great. Still, I don't think this way of telling a story should be popularized, because we have better ways of implementing it: videogames. Leave the formula for them, that way it can be taken to work on it's full potential, unlike with movies.
So, I would recommend Bandersnatch, but if you don't connect with the movie at the first 10 minutes, or you don't have that much patience, or you hate those TellTale games...you can skip it.<br/><br/>P.S: Will Poulter rocks</div>]",9495224

Technology is evolving every single day and things that were the stuff of science fiction are slowly but surely becoming commonplace. Like with this movie. Choose Your Own Adventure stories had to be done through books, because that was the only way to do them without it being hellishly difficult. Or you could do it with computers, but then you ended up adding more features, at which point they become video games.<br/><br/>But now we have online streaming. Which allowed CYOA stories to finally step into the halls of cinema. And what better team to pull this new, radical concept through than Black Mirror.<br/><br/>So does it work? I'd say mostly yes. There are some hiccups and some aggravating things, but overall it's a really cool, thematic journey into a boy's psyche as he tries to finish a video game in the early years of computers. Back when games could be made by a single talented coder. But events of the past, as well as his own mental health problems, rear their ugly head and make the process much more difficult.<br/><br/>On the technical side of things, the film works really well. The traditional film making is flawlessly executed by the director David Slade, but I also have to praise the CYOA aspects. The choices and the transitions into them are done beautifully. They're smooth, easy to navigate and you know what you're choosing. And that last part is very important and often the downfall of these kinds of stories, I've felt.<br/><br/>That being said, the story itself had some problems. I, for example, didn't care how meta it was. It's a CYOA story about a coder coding a CYOA game. That's just needlessly lazy writing. There was also the slight problem that the story often forced you to go through a certain scene. All the branches collapsed into one and you felt like you had accomplished nothing. Sure, it turned out that the previous choices had meaning and even the earliest choices influenced what kind of ending paths you could access, but while I was going through the story, I felt cheated.<br/><br/>And sure, it's a matter of budget. You can't really film a story where there are essentially two or three, or even more, whole stories to be experienced. Where you can turn left at the first choice and jump off the beaten path. Or well, you could. It'd just be hellishly expensive. But down on some level you wish for that scope, that possibility.<br/><br/>At the very least these mandatory scenes have to go.

Why? Not because it's impossible (it has been done occasionally), but because the creators cannot (or will not) afford the player missing out on any content.<br/><br/>But real story branching doesn't have to mean missing out on content, or that content is wasted.

53030622,6 January 2019,"[<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">Netflix's Original Black Mirror: Bandersnatch has an innovative take on media. One of its kind, Bandersnatch tries hardy to cover as much as possible areas of interactions. Marked by haphazardly thrown narratives and plotlines, the movie takes its time to launch, gaining attention more than character developments. The transition of plotlines is held together by thin branches of linear narrations. However, the launch is a bit slow. The fact that they could have developed characters at a faster rather than making the audience accustomed to the narrative style, is a bit underwhelming.
You get into the story with the central character, Stephan, a shy, introverted teenager who happens to be a genius at coding. Stephan reads a book by a J.F. Davies called Bandersnatch and tries to develop a game based on it, which happens to be named after one of Lewis Carrols' characters. The whole plot revolves around Stephen questioning the existence of his free will, and exploring the meaning of choices. However, the avoidance of biblical allegories is quite impressive. Various significances and tiny Easter Eggs have been hidden in the storylines at which, before your notice, the story takes over. As you get used to Stephen's childhood trauma and the repetition of scenes and understand the effects, you're hit with a thought. How did you miss this? You'd have seen everything you've been hinted with, pointed right at this if only you'd been paying attention. Now you begin to understand. Now you're relating things.
As the port of acknowledgement gets left behind, you begin to gain speed. Now you're curious about the plot. Now you care for the narratives. You want to know how Stephan is going to react to his dominant father. You begin to foresee the consequences. Every plot seems relevant now. As the story begins to explore different options, you begin to explore something for yourself. Little do you know that they've been trying to make you do this all along, an answer to which, they've already made on their terms.
The makers have definitely written a good script. However, Bandersnatch feels like a first-person Source Code at times and Donnie Darko at others, questioning philosophical explanations of life. It feels as if the questions are being asked continuously without the wait for an answer. The concept of free will is toppled by the grave consequence of the allegory of the cave, wrapped by thin partitioning, and almost feels like an easter egg.
Bandersnatch, as a whole, the newest addition to an interaction themed narration which launches a new domain of visual media, tries its best to incept the idea into the audience. As much as we hope it to succeed, there's something missing and the viewers are left somewhat half-content. Hopefully the launching pad this movie has provided attracts other film makers and creators and ropes them into developing the platform further.</div>]",9495224

Making different choices gives you either a very short movie or an over 5h long movie.

In this film, the protagonist is a young video game programmer in the 80's, whose destiny is controlled by none other than the people watching him, as he struggles to make deadlines and questions the reality in which he lives.<br/><br/>First, the negatives. The whole timeline of the film seems like a video game where the path you choose feels to be rather forced, where the path to take is too ""obvious"" and if you choose a wrong path, you die, and try again from the last point. Granted, there are several moments where you make the decision for the character. But in the end, how much control does the audience really have? Not much. Additionally, it was rather short, which is funny when (and if) you see a certain ""review"" of the Bandersnatch game in the movie itself. How the character debates his own ability to choose for himself, and his own awareness, was a good idea, but the execution was a tad mediocre.<br/><br/>Now the positives. It's engaging for sure, and the story is quite interesting. The acting certainly isn't bad at all, and it is indeed a fun, thrilling ride. Just like the ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" books, on which many of us grew up, you can go back from a mistake, or a wrong path, and see what another path will take you.

Not because it is good or has a single redeeming factor, but because if Ed Wood set out intentionally with an unlimited budget to make the worst movie ever, he could not have made something this bad.<br/><br/>The law of large numbers would seem to imply that in 86 minutes you'd have to get something right by accident, and yet this movie doesn't. A second look at Alien Apocalypse (which admittedly requires a masochistic nature to undertake) at least reveals passable cinematography and consistent lighting. And yet Sharknado rises above mathematics to give us a film that is bad in every single possible way.<br/><br/>Continuity is shrugged off completely. The same scene moves from daylight to dusk, rain to sunshine, storm surge to quiet beach, with every single new camera angle. It is so blatantly bad you are distracted from the more subtle inconsistencies like objects moving around, attire, wind, or quality of film from one cut to the next.<br/><br/>If you manage to close your eyes you are immediately taken in by the sound. How the sound editor managed to get to work on what had to be an acid-enhanced bender of epic proportions to warrant these results is beyond me. I'm reluctant to suggest using your stereo's sound-leveling technology for fear your sound system will simply melt from the strain.<br/><br/>One is almost loath to point a finger at suspension of disbelief when it comes to a movie whose premise is sharks in tornadoes, but whatever level you plan to come in with is almost surely going to fall far short. This movie has more WTF moments in 86 minutes than Lost could pull off in 86 seasons. And everyone gets to play, not just those with a working knowledge of wind shear or the physics that keep a helicopter in the air. If you've played pool, fished, surfed, driven a car in water deeper than two inches, been exposed to gravity, or otherwise in any way have interacted with or gained some understanding of the world around you, this movie has something for you to go ""wha!?!"" about.<br/><br/>And while you would think that once you had bad special effects, bad editing, and bad sound strung together you'd get at least one Bruce Campbell out of the cast to latch on to. Not so here, as every actor turned in a performance that shows they were more confused than the viewer about what was happening. We could guess it was because they were given the script out of order, but as a viewer of the final product I'm not sure I've seen the scenes in order, they are that disjointed.<br/><br/>I've tried very hard to find something that was done well or noteworthy about this movie and the only thing I can come up with is that it is the only movie I have ever seen that has failed on absolutely every level. If you tried to make a movie this bad you would inadvertently get something right purely on accident. And that is its one bright, shining point of light.

Therefore, I don't watch stalker or slasher movies.<br/><br/>There are sharks coming from every direction when they're catapulted into the sky by a freak storm that carries them everywhere. No place is safe.<br/><br/>Common sense is rarely used in this type of movie. I'll admit that ""The Birds"" is in a different league, but I always wonder why no one thinks to wear a hat that could deter at least some of the birds for awhile, especially a construction hat or football helmet. In Sharknado the sharks are vicious and hungry. Why no one in this movie can get away from these sharks baffles me. There are so many that its easy to get pelted by one. Pelted and then chewed, even swallowed. No one seems to remember that sharks can't walk or run on the land. Once they land on the ground, they would be stuck without rushing water to move them along.. Our hero---played by Ian Ziering---and his family and friends must take a proactive approach to fight these big fish while waiting for the torrential storms to pass.<br/><br/>This movie has some great foreshadowing.

44265443,17 July 2013,"[<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">Let me just say that I watched this movie to be entertained—not enthralled or hanging on the edge of my seat but just distracted and carefree for a couple of hours. I got what I wanted. Only, I didn't expect to laugh so much. I'm thankful for the laughter, though, because it kept at bay any sort of aesthetic sense that might have interfered with my viewing pleasure.<br/><br/>Regardless of genre, most movies are a construction of thoughtfully planned scenes, each of which presenting plot points and character motivations that, together, form a plausible narrative, allowing for the proverbial ""suspension of disbelief."" Such careful craftsmanship is never more important than at a film's beginning. The creators of Sharknado didn't bother with any of that. <br/><br/>There is an opening sequence involving a fishing boat on a stormy sea. On board a greedy captain in a raincoat and an Asian man in a three- piece suit squabble about money (presumably for some nefarious service performed by the captain). Handguns are soon brandished, bullets are fired, and chomping sharks are washed on deck by the waves (à la The Perfect Storm). People are shot or eaten, and a massive water spout filled with digitally-rendered sharks stretches into the sky. Then the opening credits begin rolling, and it's as if that scene never happened. Other than the brief preview of the ""sharknado"" to come at the end of the second act (yes, I'm taking some liberties by using standard film vernacular to describe this storyline), it was as if this scene was jumbled together from leftover footage of some other SyFy shark movie. Did this bother me? Nope. In fact, it wasn't until after the movie's end that I even remembered the ship's captain and the shootout on the water. By then, I was still grinning too much to care. <br/><br/>One grin-evoking moment occurs when Nova, the leading female character played by Cassie Scerbo, stabs a shark to death with a cue stick in a bar. While this isn't the first shark encounter for the protagonists or even the first shark-on-land encounter, it does seem to set the tone for the rest of the movie. Anthony Ferrante, the director, wants everyone to realize that this is not—and does not aspire to be—Jaws. <br/><br/>Though he need not worry about anyone mistaking this shark movie for Steven Spielberg's classic, Ferrante repeatedly makes references to it. I won't use terms such as ""allusion"" or even ""homage"" to describe these references. Perhaps ""farcical"" might be more appropriate, or maybe ""comic relief,"" but even those terms lend themselves to a more contemplative critique than I am attempting. <br/><br/>I think Ferrante's purpose was to preemptively counter all would-be critics who might say things like ""This is no Jaws."" He could have just titled the movie Another Killer Shark Film That Is Not Jaws. But that would have been too self-effacing and certainly not as much fun.<br/><br/>In carrying out this strategy, Ferrante doesn't waste much time. Moments after the sharks begin plopping onto the streets and docks, Fin—a bar-owner, father and former pro-surfer played by Ian Ziering of Beverly Hills, 90210 fame—makes quick work of one by shooting a diver's air tank that is jutting out of its gullet, causing it and the shark to explode. Remind you of anything? Yep, there's even a corny one-liner: ""That's what you get for trying to eat me."" <br/><br/>Later we have a quasi-touching expository scene that reveals Nova's pre-established hatred of sharks. The character of Fin's son, Matt, played by Chuck Hittinger, notices an unusual scar on Nova's thigh. To get her to talk about it, he lifts up his shirt and reveals a scar on his abdomen and explains its not-so-dramatic origin. When he asks Nova how she got her scar, she says she had a tattoo removed. Not buying it, Matt prods further and Nova tells a story about going fishing with her grandfather and his friends when she was a little girl. She says that their boat sank and sharks began to circle and attack them. The men managed to lift her out of the water and onto something floating nearby, but a shark still managed to take a hunk out of her leg. In summation, Nova says: ""Six people went into the water and one little girl came out. The sharks took the rest."" <br/><br/>The scene in Jaws in which Robert Shaw's character Quint tells the tale of the sinking of the USS Indionapolis is arguably one of the most memorable scenes in film history. Ferrante knows this. Nova's scar story, in a tongue-in-cheek sort of way, serves to again make the director's statement: ""I am aware of Jaws, as is everyone in the civilized world, and this is not that movie!""<br/><br/>Later, this same point is made again, this time even more comically and pointedly. After fabricating some propane bombs, Nova and Matt take to the skies in a helicopter to hunt the tornadoes. Matt flies perilously close to one of the funnel clouds so that Nova can toss one of the bombs into it. She sees an enormous shark coming straight at them and declares: ""We're gonna need a bigger chopper.""<br/><br/>If you want to be moderately entertained, then I don't think you will be disappointed with Sharknado. Don't expect too much going into it—and bring with you a willingness to suspend your own sense of disbelief. Most important, keep in mind that this is not Jaws. I don't think that fact will slip you mind, however. The director made sure of it.</div>]",2724064

Wiseau put a lot of time and effort into it and it was utter crap. Sharknado was made to be dumbed down to reach their target audience and make them feel smarter than the movie. You can't point and laugh at the director because this is what he wanted all along. What makes a film ""So bad it's good"" is sincerity.

Quite obviously, the Asylum-formula works very effectively: cast a bunch of washed up Hollywood stars in degrading roles (that they don't even seem to mind), hire an army of marijuana-addicted monkeys to pen down the most over-the-top absurd screenplay imaginable (including deliberate mistakes and impossible twists) and waste the little bit of budget that you have on preposterous digital effects.

People are struggling to escape from the sharks in the pouring rain, while two streets further down the sun is shining brightly and everyone is minding their own business. Vicious 1,000lb tiger sharks are swimming around in the hero's living room, while outside the front door there isn't a single drop of water on the driveway. The storm winds are forceful enough to tear loose the letters of the Hollywood sign, but the people manage to remain standing on their feet. There's plenty more similar foolishness like this, as well as ridiculous gore (sawing sharks in half with a chainsaw, anyone?) and moronic dialogs (we're gonna need a bigger chopper). The nicest thing you could say about ""Sharknado"" is that it isn't pretentious, misleading or boring. It's awful rubbish, and traditionally I just have to reward it with the lowest possible score, but I'm not embarrassed to admit I was tremendously amused.</div>]",2724064

Perhaps the filmmakers should have allotted less of the budget towards luring Tara Reid out of oblivion, and more on, say, hiring a decent editor. I can stomach bad acting, bad writing, bad special effects no problem. But I am not kidding when I say a high schooler could have done a better job editing this film.

16567067,20 July 2013,"[<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">You know, Syfy movies haven't gotten a good rep lately. In fact, most of them just rely on horrible CGI effects and non-innovative stories just to squeeze in an hour and 30 minutes of crap onto television. Sharknado is different. Sharknado relies on amazing practical effects, a more-than solid story, and acting that honestly deserves an academy award or two. This movie stands out from the rest and is one of the most mind-bending and in your face-intense movies I have ever set eyes on. If you were planning on doing anything today, watch Sharknado.<br/><br/>First of all, the practical effects are amazing. In the tornado's, you can actually see the rubber and animatronic sharks come to life. Each one of them biting and gnawing and trying to bite whatever is in their path, which is just air. When people do get eaten, it's not just one motion with people's screaming inserted in post-production. I honestly believe real people died in the making of this film. The effects were so good, I couldn't tell what was real and what was fake. A scene where a member of the cast is violently thrown into a sharks mouth was the highlight of the entire film. It made little impact on him however due to the chainsaw he had in his hand. And make no mistake, there is zero ounce of stock footage. Everything was done on set. If you are a practical effects junkie, this will be your favorite part of the film. It's absolutely brilliant and made me rethink my life's choices as to going into IT Security. Maybe I should hop into a makeup school and do practical effects for future Syfy movies. I'm sure my choice would be beyond lucrative and filled with no regret.<br/><br/>But, I digress. I know what people are reading this review for, the story. The story, hands down, deserves some sort of award. With no delay, Peter McCallister from Home Alone is getting drunk by himself at a beach bar and suddenly, SHARKS! Immediately the practical effect sharks slam into the windows killing everyone in their path. The outside shots of the bar show no waves, but the inside is a deadzone of blood, guts, and practical effects flown all over the place. From then on the main character must go to Tara Reid's decrepit, career like, house to save his family from the ensuing shark attack. There is no less then a three hour car ride to the house in what the characters call a Jeep, when it's really a Toyota (I love how the actors really made it think they were driving a jeep. Ballsy move by the filmmakers to make the viewer actually question the minds of the main characters) and we get to see every minute of it. Which, is fine because this must be some of the most though-provoking dialogue in a movie. Quentin Tarantino, take note..there is a future writer coming to town and he doesn't have time for your bullshit! I can't say much more about the story due to it's fantastic story that you must see, but I will say that this film is so ballsy that it doesn't even rely on the use of side-stories or characters. Main characters are all you need!<br/><br/>Overall, I'm saying this movie needs an Academy Award or two for best acting or writing. This movie changed my life in a way which I didn't think a movie could. Some say cave men drew images on walls and acted them out like a play. If the world ever comes to an end, future civilizations will see Sharknado written on walls. Sharknado drawn next to a trash can or maybe a landfill. Future civilizations will question why such a great film is next to dying and smelly things. The only answer is that this movie sucked so much balls, that you need to watch it with a group of no less then 2 and no more than 20 to fully appreciate the shittiness of everything in it. One of the worst movies I have ever seen and I never had more fun making fun of any other film.</div>]",2724064

892646,9 September 2013,"[<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">In sunny Los Angeles, California, it's raining sharks!<br/><br/>As ridiculous and impossible as it sounds, SyFy has really managed to outdo themselves, and not in a particularly good, campy way. 2013's Anthony C. Ferrante-directed SyFy shark-fest ""Sharknado"" has become a bona-fide pop culture phenomenon, after the movie ignited an enormous media sensation on Twitter during - and after - its July 11, 2013, premiere, and even subsequently prompted limited theatrical releases all across the country not long afterward. The problem is, at least from what I can tell, is that ""Sharknado's"" surprise success is unique to this film only, and is not likely to be repeated any time soon (perhaps not even with its proposed 2014 sequel, the aptly named ""Sharknado 2: The Second One"").<br/><br/>In other words, the success of ""Sharknado"" was a fluke, probably because it's more ridiculous and inane than most of SyFy's usual fanfare. I say this because I've seen more than my fair share of SyFy's usual offerings, which are many times god-awful (though I'll express a fondness for ""Jersey Shore Shark Attack"" and ""Tasmanian Devils""). ""Sharknado"" has grudgingly earned a spot as the best film SyFy has put out yet, but only because of the media sensation it's stirred up in recent months, which is why I gave it an ""8"" - the highest rating I've ever given a SyFy ""original"" picture.<br/><br/>There really isn't much of a story, but I'll try anyway: In Los Angeles, the city is suffering the effects of Hurricane David, after the storm ravaged parts of Mexico and is now moving north up the California coastline. Now I'm no meteorologist, but I don't think hurricanes occurring in the Pacific Ocean can travel anywhere except in a western or northwestern direction. Add to that, I've never heard of a hurricane making landfall anywhere on the American West Coast. And I've definitely never heard of a hurricane flinging sharks around in the air and then depositing those same man-eating sharks to dine on unsuspecting Los Angelenos.<br/><br/>In the thick of it, famed surfing legend Finley ""Fin"" Shepard (Ian Ziering) attempts to locate, and escort to safety, his various estranged family members - who include his ex-wife April (""American Pie"" series regular Tara Reid) - who are spread out in various parts of Beverly Hills and Van Nuys and they must also brave rising flood waters and the carnivorous sharks that the massive storm has also washed ashore. He's joined by his Tasmanian best bud Baz Hogan (Jaason Simmons), sexy waitress Nova Clarke (Cassie Scerbo), and local drunk George (John Heard).<br/><br/>That's about all there is to be said about this film's ""plot.""<br/><br/>Until then, you have to deal with the ludicrous premise and gory shark attacks, and occasionally very stupid one-liners (""It must be that time of the month again,"" Baz says, after a shark has just dined on April's new husband). In watching the over-the-top gore in this flick, you can't help but crack a laugh here &amp; there - mostly at the absurdity of everything that's going on. It appears that no one took the premise of ""Sharknado"" seriously (though I've heard in some venues that the filmmakers did take everything they put here on-screen SERIOUSLY and all I ask is, ""Why?""). And how could they? Even the script by Thunder Levin is too ridiculous to be truly believable. You turn your brain off for 90 minutes and just enjoy the fun, but bumpy ride.<br/><br/>I know it sounds like I'm giving ""Sharknado"" a bad review, but I'm actually not. What surprises me is that the movie has become a bona-fide pop culture sensation, even if it was an accident. I think it deserves it, for better or for worse; most cult classics don't happen overnight (but this one did). I think it was bound to happen at some point. But why didn't it happen to ""Jersey Shore Shark Attack"" or ""Tasmanian Devils,"" two films that are way better in terms of sheer entertainment value (and nothing else)? But, like I said, it was bound to happen sooner or later, for better or worse, and it just had to happen to ""Sharknado.""<br/><br/>P.S.: And also worth noting - and to be expected - are the various references to ""Jaws"" (1975).<br/><br/>8/10</div>]",2724064

The lines between the cast are delivered so poorly, you wonder if all the scenes were directed by the second unit while the director was having a nap.

There are movies out there with even lower budgets that stand head and shoulders above this rubbish in every conceivable department. This is all so ineptly done by the crew involved, that even a budget twenty times higher would result in Sharknado being just as bad.

A former couple (Ian Ziering, Tara Reid) must try to get out of town and save their friends and family along the way. It would be advised to turn your brain off when SHARKNADO starts up because if you come into a movie like this expecting any sort of logic then you're going to be out of luck. There are so many illogical moments here that you can't help but laugh and have a good time with the film. I think my favorite moments has to be when the family are trapped inside their house because the first floor of their home is flooded and now sharks are in there. However, for some reason, when they get outside to the car there's no flood so if there's no water outside their front door then how on Earth was the first floor flooded? There are countless other issues like this but obviously you shouldn't take them seriously and instead just sit back, drink a beer and laugh. The special effects are pretty much what you expect from The Asylum as they're cheap, laughable and at times incredibly bad. The funniest effect are the scenes with a model shark that are often used to punch. These things are so fake looking that you can't help but laugh. The performances are nearly as bad as you might expect and Ziering actually manages to hold you attention. I also thought it was fun seeing John Heard in his small role and Cassie Scerbo is also nice. Reid, on the other hand, appears out of it throughout most of her scenes as her ""emotion"" never matches anything that is happening in the scene. SHARKNADO is the type of bad ""C"" film that I enjoy watching because it puts everything bad about it on the back burner and at least delivers some cheap entertainment, which is something hard to come by.</div>]",2724064

OK so i rated this movie low, lets not forget its a low budget movie with little to no effects. With that said it still delivers an entertaining movie! As much as you want too you can't turn your eyes away from the screen, sharks are flying everywhere its total mayhem and its fantastic! Sure the acting isn't great but the actors really try and deliver their lines with enough panic and enthusiasm that you start to really engage with them or more to point tolerate them!

One of the biggest pluses here is the fact that there's an incredibly novel method of continuously getting a ton of action into the effort. The concept of the film where the wind and rain of a tornado drop the sharks deep into the heart of the city, gives this plenty to like as there's a unique setup at play here taking sharks away from the water where they're known to live and placing them on dry land letting the ferocity and intensity of their attacks take place in a new locale. This is a fun idea, and the images of them floundering away at the hapless citizens makes for quite a bit of fun with several key sequences that are an absolute blast to watch. The first attack on the beach where the surfers are attacked in the beach come off really nicely with the panic in the surf followed by the scenes of them dropping on the beach patrons which is plenty of fun. The ensuing escape into the streets with the crowded freeway being flooded and then overrun with sharks provides even more fun, and with the rescue attempts featured throughout here the action is enhanced even more along with the attack at the house which is plenty of fun with sharks crashing through causing the destruction of the house. There's more fun with the later rescue attempts and the different plans to shut it down offering some big action here as they go for the ridiculous concepts rather nicely. The finale is also quite a bit of fun to get through that has a rather fun vibe to it that makes for a strong overall finish to this, and with the action scenes of the hurricane touching down early on that causes widespread destruction along the way as well as the plentiful gore along the way provides this with plenty to like. The CGI is a mess, as always, which really amounts to the only flaw here as well as the constant and irritating size discrepancies that pop up from time-to-time as well due to the fact that the different species of sharks utilized tend to vary as well within the sequence, and when inserts featuring animatronic props or real-live sharks are put into play it's a little distracting. Overall, though, there's a lot to like with this one.<br/><br/>Rated R: Graphic Violence and Language.</div>]",2724064
482513,19 July 2014,"[<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">SHARKNADO, a typical SyFy Channel B-movie that's received popular attention thanks to the outrageousness of its premise, turns out to be a surprisingly entertaining little B-movie that delivers on the enjoyment scale. That's because the narrative is extremely fast-paced, eschewing the usual first-half-set-up nonsense in favour of throwing the viewer straight into the storyline...and it works.<br/><br/>Essentially, this consists of a group of characters fighting off torrential storms, flooding, and the titular menace, which involves various sharks being sucked up from the ocean by tornadoes and subsequently being dropped on American cities. There's constant action and cheesy gore effects as various people (read: extras) are torn to pieces by the maritime monsters, and it's all as ridiculous and over-the-top as you'd hope for.<br/><br/>Nobody goes into this expecting good acting, and you won't be surprised by the woeful performances of, for example, Tara Reid (Cassie Scerbo is much better). Ian Ziering used to be in BEVERLY HILLS 90210, apparently, but he gives one of the most stilted performances I've seen in a while; Jaason Simmons, as the Aussie guy, is much better. John Heard is bloated and unrecognisable from his HOME ALONE days.<br/><br/>SHARKNADO is a film filled with cheesy CGI effects and plenty of continuity errors and plot holes; the constantly changing water levels are probably the silliest thing about it. Yet, it knows exactly what it is and the tongue-in-cheek yet serious approach pays off, making this funnier than many comedies, as it never tries too hard to be funny. It's the kind of switch-off-the-brain entertainment that I rate highly as a good-time film.</div>]",2724064
4491153,24 August 2013,"[<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">It's impossible to rate this film according to IMDb criteria as it operates under unique filmmaking rules. The continuity and editing just do their own thing so the viewer totally accepts the way in which a shot of a shark supposedly swimming about in a roadway suddenly cuts to a close up that shows said shark basking in deep azure Pacific seas. But the use of jarring stock footage is truly an art form in bad movie circles, and more of it, I say! Everyone knows the plot, and you get the impression that the film was constructed in the wake of a night out that involved one of the producers declaring: ""Imagine one of those terror storm movies involving sharks! A sharknado, if you will!"" The next day a poster was produced and the film hung on that. So, in the midst of weather systems that come and go, sharks that change size and leap from here, there, and everywhere, and an interminable bus rescue, the cast is game, although Tara Reid looks a bit bewildered by what is going on at times, while John Heard pretty much forms a double act with a bar stool. By conventional standards, the film would garner a 4, but this opus writes its own rules, and I thank the Elder Gods Ed Wood and Roger Corman that such chaotic, but marvellous, spectacles still get made.</div>]",2724064
28840957,3 August 2013,"[<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">sharknado is the very best asylum / syfy TV movie i've ever seen and actually one of the only ones to rise above a 4. i'm glad to see the best one have such success--i saw it at a midnight screening in union square new york.<br/><br/>i hate the term guilty pleasure, because i feel no guilt when i enjoy a movie that delivers what it promises. sharknado delivers. it does not promise existential dilemma nor poignant allegory. it promises a feature length experience centered on the concept of sharks in a tornado...and succeeds.<br/><br/>the only real close competition from the syfy folks is air collision, which is an incredible piling on of the unbelievable and the illogical that seems conceived of by an imaginative child. like air collision, sharknado is a commendable example of how to take one event and stretch it out to feature length, which is no easy task when the event is 'sharks in a tornado' or 'two planes are about to crash in midair.' <br/><br/>amazingly, sharknado does not pad it's first act with drama minutiae, but quickly deliver some action and so the escalation of events really continues throughout the whole movie. and when the sharknado is finally glimpsed, it is actually pretty stunning to look at---certainly the zenith achievement of cg visual fx in a syfy movie. <br/><br/>intentional and unintentional humor fills the movie, and there's also stuff where i can't tell if they knew it was funny or not---such as the melodramatic monologues---but i had tears pouring down at one point i was laughing so hard. and there is a coincidence towards the end that may be the single funniest and least likely coincidence in movie history.<br/><br/>sharknado whirls quickly from one creative set piece to another and is engaging throughout.<br/><br/>a solid b picture from asylum, and their finest hour. i hope to see more at this level, because i like this energetic and creative low budget picture far more than most of the 100 million dollar pieces of junk i've seen come out of Hollywood in the last few years.</div>]",2724064
20552756,22 July 2013,"[<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">Far from great, and it is easy for anybody- regardless of whether they are taking it too seriously or not- to criticise it, but Sharknado is also one of SyFy's/The Asylum's more tolerable and most fun to watch movies. That is saying a lot actually because usually with a few exceptions they are terrible(sometimes irredeemably so) There are some negatives that is difficult to overlook. The worst asset was the acting of Tara Reid, she doesn't look as though she was having any fun at all and acted at times like a porn actress trying to act, very mechanical and ill at ease. John Heard also has moments where he overacts to a painful degree, but still he looks as though he's trying so he isn't as problematic. The next worst thing were the special effects(nearly always one of the worst assets of their movies, so that was expected), they are some of the better effects to appear in SyFy's/The Asylum's output but the fact that they look so artificial and though they were made in a rush doesn't make that say very much. Thankfully, the melodrama and exposition is mostly kept minimal, but when Sharknado does go into that territory it falls flat with some overwrought clunkiness and where things lag slightly, not a surprise because exposition and melodrama has always been one of SyFy's/The Asylum's weak points. And if you are looking to see if there is any plausible science, look for another movie because the science here is rather dumb and impossible, enough to make scientists or anybody studying or teaching it despair.<br/><br/>Flaws aside, the exotic locations and photography that looks as though effort was made into making what was happening on screen coherent made for a movie that for how bad the effects are was serviceable technically. The music has a couple of creepy moments without being too derivative, but generally it stays true to the snappy tongue-in-cheek nature of the writing and story. The script can go overboard with the corniness at times but mostly it is witty and tongue-in-cheek, the banter is very amusing and the ""looks like it's that time of the month"" line is a classic, as well as snappily delivered. As for the story, really we can tell from the premise alone what to expect from Sharknado and what the quality is going to be. Reading the premise, it was clear that Sharknado was going to be ridiculous. And it was, and it was also clear that the movie and those behind it knew it as well. The difference was though that it was entertaining too(and the most original SyFy/The Asylum have had in a long time), the movie is surprisingly well paced and actually has a cohesive structure at times, helped by that it's not as melodrama/exposition-heavy as some of their other movies and that it actually knows what to do with itself. The sharks are not very well designed, but they actually have a personality, sometimes menacing but often with a goofy sense of fun, which makes their scenes fun. Their scenes admittedly are hilariously chaotic and incredibly dumb but interweave within the nature of the story very well, there are even scenes that are bust-a-gut-laughing-worthy, like character chainsawing their way out of a shark. The characters are not well developed, neither are they annoying. Likewise the acting isn't award worthy, but there's been much worse. The best of the lot is Ian Ziering, he's very funny and has good charisma, the character starts out a little obnoxious but you actually grow to like him.<br/><br/>All in all, not a great movie with some obvious flaws and maybe overpraised by some reviewers, but it is a lot of fun to watch and for a SyFy/Asylum movie it is one of their better ones. Not a 10/10 movie but nowhere near bad enough for a 1. Personal rating would be a 6/10, sort of a decent/guilty pleasure rating. Bethany Cox</div>]",2724064

It's almost like a zombie film was intended but at the very last minute someone burst into the office and said let's use sharks and have tornados. It's not meant to be taken seriously, I don't think the producers looked for awards, instead they delivered ninety minutes of enjoyable nonsense. Some of the effects are ok, some are pretty poor, they do however beat the stock footage shots. Plenty of continuity errors, rain one moment, dry the next etc, but I won't knock it any more, that would be too easy. It's ridiculous, outrageous, but funny and imaginative, that line 'we're gonna need a bigger chopper' felt like a thumbs up to the greatest shark movie of all time.

Think 'The Day after Tomorrow' and times it by ten then you get this unbelievable catastrophe of a weather disaster. The film is based around L.A, (ok no surprises so far) when a strong hurricane comes ashore this storm produces tornadoes nothing to surprising there either but when sharks start breeding out of these monsters the whole idea of this film being taken somewhat seriously starts to unravel dramatically. It gets worse but i'll let you discover that yourselves. In a purely generic sense i should not be too shocked by all this as it is a sci-fi but with bad acting and a terrible story-line i would rather take my chances a raging ice storm than sit through this again!</div>]",2724064
1623954,10 August 2013,"[<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">Clearly this movie knew what it was, and they did an amazing job with it. The plot, while slightly unrealistic, was still grounded enough so that we didn't feel like we were in ""fantasy-land"". Basically, a ""Sandy""-like hurricane hits southern California, just after a shifty sea captain is trying to unload 20,000 sharks to a nefarious businessman. The timing couldn't be worse but luckily Ian Ziering who is a successful bar owner and former Coast Guard member is there to help. He can't save everyone, but he does a great job as the determined ""everyman"" who just wants to help. He and his sensual bartender (Cassie Scerbo), his Aussie best friend(Jaason Simmons), and his lovable ragamuffin boozy buddy (John Heard!!!) decide they are going to try to save not only themselves but whoever else they can. This includes the always sexy Tara Reid, who plays the ex-wife of Ziering's character. Clearly no woman in her right mind would ever divorce Ian Ziering, and you can tell this because the chemistry between Ziering and Reid is white hot. It adds an amazing layer to this film because you can see the underlying theme going on through Reid's mind the entire time trying to resolve her feelings. She's in love, but she also wants to fly free. It's honestly amazing. After Ziering saves his wife and daughter, he must save his son. When they find him, he does not disappoint. He's the son every man wishes he had. I wish he looked more like Ziering, but the casting was still amazing. While he didn't look too much like Ziering, he was so full of personality and machismo that I didn't even let that distract me. His charisma and his chemistry with the buxom and sultry Scerbo makes the last part of the movie so amazing. He basically finds his soul mate, and she hers. Then they get put in a crazy situation which they may not survive. I also think it's brilliant that this all happens in the last 5 minutes because it perfectly illustrates life as it can really be. All in all, Sharknado is what you think it is. A bit of a stretch maybe, but grounded in realism and an all around knockout performance by it's cast. Ziering and Reid's unspoken sexual bond makes this sharknado really fly high and bright.</div>]",2724064

What thrilled me about this movie is that it actually delivers in giving us a Sharknado instead of just dialog about a Sharknado.

I was afraid this would be the case here too, but to my surprise it is not.<br/><br/>I went and saw Sharknado at the one night theatrical screening on August 3rd at 12:05 AM (2013).

I will crown this movie as the best Asylum film I've seen.<br/><br/>I hope that this will influence future Asylum/Syfy movies in the future to deliver by giving us what they are advertising on the covers.

22919981,17 July 2013,"[<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">My favorite moment of this movie is when a shark comes flying towards Steve from BEVERLY HILLS 90210 and he cleaves it in half with a chainsaw. No, wait, it's a little later, at the very end of the movie: Steve has just used that very same chainsaw to carve his way out of a shark so massive it is practically a submarine, and then he shares a kiss with his estranged wife Tara Reid, and his mouth is covered in shark blood and you can just see her going ""ew, that's disgusting""—and it is the finest piece of acting Reid manages to accomplish in this whole thing, doubtless because she wasn't acting at all. It truly is disgusting, fake blood or not.<br/><br/>And fake blood it so obviously is, as is everything about this deliciously deplorable made-for-TV film. The sharks are fake (except when they're stock footage), the effects are fake, the breasts are fake. The romantic tension between Steve and the much-younger Nova (Cassie Scerbo) is fake, the family discord is fake, hell, probably the only thing that isn't fake is sidekick Baz's (Jaason Simmons) Australian accent, which makes for a pleasant change when it comes to these kinds of things.<br/><br/>I keep calling our hero Steve, by the way, but of course his name is Fin (Ian Ziering) here – 'cause, get it? – and he is a former World Champion surfer (""The best surfer I've ever seen,"" praises one doomed character) who owns a bar on a prime piece of the Santa Monica pier. Little does he suspect that an unfortunate confluence of circumstance will soon cause him to lose that bar: an illegal shark poaching operation in the deep ocean collides with Hurricane David, closing in fast after devastating Mexico, meaning that a hundred thousand sharks – let me write that in numbers, so it sinks in better: 100,000 sharks! – of several different species find themselves swept along with a tidal wave into the Southern California shore. And man, are these sharks cranky. You know, it's always particularly hilarious in these things when the animals are given no reason at all for their blood lust they're sharks, and so therefore they want to attack people indiscriminately, apparently. Take that, Science!<br/><br/>This is, of course, far from the last beating that Science takes in this movie. From the improbability of sharks swimming down suburban streets six miles inland to the outright absurdity of a helicopter hovering mere feet away from a violent tornado (sorry: sharknado!), there is very little in this film that makes logical sense. There are scenes where young Nova blasts sharks with a shotgun and scenes where she bombs them with homemade explosives and scenes where a bus full of school kids is saved from a rampaging school of killer sharks by a tenuous-looking pulley system. It's ridiculous, of course, it's ALL RIDICULOUS, and with that stipulated, SHARKNADO is uproariously entertainingly awful fun.<br/><br/>True, I am an outspoken proponent of just this kind of cheesy B-grade Animals Attack! movie. Whether it's old school creature features like CUJO and THEM! or the cynical-yet-awesome of MEGA SHARK VS GIANT OCTOPUS and its ilk (also productions of this particular ""mockbuster"" maker, Asylum Films), give me a freak weather pattern or an irradiated insect colony, an unearthed prehistoric beast or an unscrupulous developer disrupting migration patterns, and then set the resultant man-killing creatures loose on an unsuspecting vacation destination, and I am one very happy girl. So my judgment when it comes to SHARKNADO is not at all to be trusted, unless you too are a fan of this particular genre of dreadful. I mean, sharks get rammed by surfboards and killed by pool cues. A sappy family drama, simultaneously unnecessary and insufficiently explained, is woven into things (poor Tara Reid is given kids who are probably only a few years younger than she is; she and Fin started young), and the acting throughout is almost as bad as the directing, which is almost as bad as the CGI, which is almost as bad as the plot. What the hell the genial and accomplished John Heard (you know him; Kevin's dad from Home Alone) was doing here I do not know, except that perhaps his barfly drunkard was ""as himself,"" and he really needs the cash to pay his actual bar tab?<br/><br/>Regardless, look at the title, folks. SHARKNADO! You go into this one knowing exactly what you're getting, and if you can't be satisfied with:<br/><br/>a) some used-to-be-somewhat-famous stars (in addition to Ziering, Heard and Reid, Simmons is known for his work on BAYWATCH);<br/><br/>b) a few decent quips (a door is locked; quoth Nova: ""Guys, stand back. I have a key"" then she shoots out the lock!);<br/><br/>c) some truly insane action sequences (though at least the shark biting the helicopter is slightly more believable here than MEGA SHARK's infamous plane scene);<br/><br/>d) a few very questionable explosions (sure, that car was leaking gasoline but why did it blow up?);<br/><br/>e) some cartoonish death throes (a guy got his arm bitten off, then his leg chewed on, and then a shark FELL ON HIM);<br/><br/>f) a ragtag bunch of civilians saving the day (exactly where the hell's the government in all of this?); and<br/><br/>g) a vague environmental message (the massive tornado was caused by Global Warming!)<br/><br/> then I wash my hands of you.<br/><br/>Just as it is to be hoped Fin washes his mouth thoroughly before his traumatized wife tries to kiss him again, or those crazy kids are never going to get back together which, of course, was totally the point of this whole story.<br/><br/>Review from GEEK SPEAK MAGAZINE - geekspeakmagazine.com</div>]",2724064

That's exactly what I thought to myself before watching this movie: ""Well, this seems stupid, let's watch.""<br/><br/>I can appreciate B-movies and cult movies, no matter how stupid they are. The makers of these probably don't give a rat's ass about what anyone else might think. In a way I see that profession as one of the best.

These films are mostly fun because of how stupid they are, but they don't always reach that level of hilarity. Did Sharknaddo reach that level? I don't think so.<br/><br/>Sharknado does have few of those amazing funny details that make it hilarious. First of all, the sharks are so shitty, yet everyone reacts to them so dramatically. One of the most ridiculous things about this film is how serious it seems.

You don't root for anyone, and it isn't that much fun you could watch it alone like the best of B- movies. <br/><br/>Of course Sharknado is bad, it's supposed to be bad.

The special effects are too cheesy to take seriously and the plot stinks. Sharknado is definitely on the same boat, but at the same time, there has to be a reason it become such a huge hit. After watching Sharknado, I see why before the film even begins. It is hilariously over-the-top, which brings this movie into the echelon of ""so bad it's good"".<br/><br/>There really isn't much to say about the plot past that last paragraph. The concept and execution are both so over-the- top that the movie becomes a comedy, even though the 2 main genres it falls in are Horror and Sci-Fi. I laughed at loud in several spots of the movie, and the play on irony is done in a way that I can't help but laugh at the movie, so it becomes fun. Also, except for Finn and Nova, I didn't really care who lived or who died, and Finn ONLY because he is the main character. Most of the supporting cast are really just perverted people who didn't put dying during a Sharknado on their upcoming To- Do Lists. The rest are either so emotionless that even Bella Swan from Twilight would be jealous while not giving 2 fücks about them and, of course, the sharks, who live the dream of being able to fly while apparently taking classes from Pac-Man on how to eat people. I even heard a few of these sharks became doctors once they got their Man-Eating Degrees, minoring in Over-the-Top Sciences.<br/><br/>The only person I could get any kind of grasp on from ending up being Nova. Sounds perverted, you ask? Well, hot as she is, she has the most flesh out of any character in the movie. It isn't much, but it's enough to make her an interesting bad-ass all on her own.<br/><br/>The special effects are corny, but that's typical of SyFy TV movies. It's supposed to look low-budget. Would it really be famed like it is now if Sharknado really had great special effects? Of course, it's popular for the wrong reasons, but Sharknado at least knows this and is honest about it.<br/><br/>All in all, you have to have your brain turned off and lighten up when watching Sharknado. Do NOT go in with anything but low expectations or you will be sorry you hadn't turned it down after watching the movie.

They've tossed out one terrible idea after another, all shot with crummy low-quality budgets and horrid acting. They've covered everything from volcanoes, killer storms, the second coming of the ice age, a mega shark fighting a giant octopus, weird cosmic anomalies, giant piranha, and so much more. They even made Titanic II. They've pretty much spat out movies with all the ferocity of a tornado hurling sharks all over the place. On top of that, The Asylum has pretty much built its entire repertoire on equally stupid films, but usually with the approach of being self-parody rather than anything to be taken seriously.<br/><br/>Now, Sharknado storms into the scene with the most ridiculous, most self-consciously stupid premise possible. That's right, this movie ventures into the realms of sheer campy absurdity, as waterspouts swirl around Los Angeles and tosses sharks in all directions! Sharks literally rain from the sky, and they go on to devour, crush, and destroy tons of hapless civilians. The film goes on to deliver loads of blood and action, but with its cheap production value, stupid story, and terrible acting, the film delivers lots of laughs as well.<br/><br/>The story for Sharknado pretty much mirrors the same formulaic disaster-movie fare you may have seen in such cinematic gems as Birdemic. You know, a bunch of characters get together, run for their lives, figure out a way to stop things. Everything that happens in Sharknado, however, pretty much throws all logic out the window. There is absolutely no logical flow of events, no real good reason for why the characters do what they do, and there's certainly zero scientific realism involved. You could watch the whole movie and dig up thousands of things that just don't make sense. Such blatant disregard for logic is part of what makes this film so darn funny. Characters are pretty flat and stupid too.<br/><br/>This film is as cheap as they come. Photography is okay, but the editing is nutty. Acting and writing are quite daft. All the sets, props, costumes, and special effects are immensely cheap; you can tell that these filmmakers just went around LA and glossed over everything with horrid CGI and cheap camera shots. Music okay: the film's score is pretty generic, but the film does use a few decent songs in the beginning.<br/><br/>With Sharknado, the people at SyFy seem to have finally given up on trying to be serious, and just flung this crazy oddity at us so we can laugh at just how stupid, absurd, and cheap the whole thing is.

Filmmakers like the Asylum are under the impression that the less you think about how to tell a story, the worse the movie. Couldn't agree less. Instead of crafting the best most epic bad movie Sharknado could be, the film feels padded by a lazy story.

While the premiere reached an audience of 1.37 million viewers, the most notable aspect of the film's success was due to the fact that the internet blew up with people discussing the film on social media. In particular twitter where it was trending worldwide, including plenty of tweets from celebrities. With that sort of publicity, Syfy decided to replay the film a week later which received an even larger viewership of 1.89 million. Syfy has since announced that they have ordered a sequel to premier in 2014, and they will be running a Twitter contest where fans can choose the subtitle for the new film. <br/><br/>One of the funniest things to come out of this internet phenomenon, is the comments made by lead actor and former 'Beverly Hills, 90210' star 'Ian Ziering' labelling himself the next John Travolta, and claiming that Sharknado is his 'Pulp Fiction' role. <br/><br/>Obviously the acting is horrible, the special effects looked dodgy and the storyline is full of plot holes, but you just don't care as this falls in the 'it is so bad, its good' category.

The ending is lacking and there is no logic here anywhere.<br/><br/>The funny thing about the film is that the cast is pretty good. Lead Ian Ziering who is most known for his TV work is above average, though just barely and that's enough for me for a film like this. American Pie star Tara Reid works but is in the background for most of the film. Long-time actor John Herd has a silly role that is very limited but he does help carry the first act. Though I like the cast members, we still don't care very much about the characters and their development is shallow all the way around.<br/><br/>When it's all said and done, maybe I shouldn't criticize a film that is not supposed to be serious in the first place. Well it might have cheese to it but it's not the type of cheese that produces a lot of good laughs and you can't really have a fun time with it. In some ways it is a film that was made to feel like a real film which it isn't and is one reason it fails for me.</div>]",2724064

(I now am re-evaluating All of my beliefs.) <br/><br/>After the opening scene, the credits start to come up. Right away I knew this was going to be a ""turn off brain to enjoy"" type movie, because the words ""Thunder Levin"" appeared on the screen. If you haven't seen 'American Warships', don't. It's also one of Levin's and while it's just as dumb, it's not nearly as much fun.<br/><br/>God bless Levin, he doesn't keep you waiting long before all hell breaks loose. You get a little bit of repetitive B-roll, a hint of character back story and then...shark attacks. After a hurricane is reported off the coast of California (not a spoiler), the shark attacks get....interesting. Increasingly so in fact. (To say more would be to spoil something for you.) <br/><br/>Suffice it to say sharks, the weather, everything in this movie ignores the limits imposed on it by physics and nature. 'Sharknado' goes on a rampage where it seems to mostly be trying to assault everything the viewer ever learned about the world. Both the horribly CGI sharks and the one-note cast take turns at clawing facts from your brain. And everybody is just so earnest about it. Even as the script steals lines from other movies. Which is what makes it so funny.<br/><br/>But the best thing about this movie is how it just Keeps. Upping. The ante. And Levin is willing to sacrifice anything to get the scene. Physics, continuity, good taste... There is a mass rescue scene that brought me near to tears laughing at the continuity of it. Thunder Levin's big finish is so.....so...that it inspires you to stare at whomever you're watching this movie with. <br/><br/>My daughter and I (found it On-Demand and) re-watched it. We also subjected my 13 year old son and my mother to this movie. My son spent the entire movie laughing and pointing out the apparent holes in Levin's education. At one point he even had to leave the room.

For some reason or other the mainstream media picked up on the ludicrous premise of shark-infested waterspouts flooding Los Angeles, and from the resulting 'acclaim' came a slow-burning unlikely success story of a loony series that boasts six movies by this point! But was the original movie ever worth the attention to begin with? Well that's really a matter of personal taste.. Now Sharknado as a movie may not have been ripping off any specific film when it came out, but it certainly ticks a lot of the classic Asylum checklist - middling to horrible acting, ugly bland locations and a confused lacklustre story, shoddy effects work that looks like it's been done by a first year graphic design student? Check!! I think it may have been the name that really grabbed everyone's attention because the actual movie to me isn't anything special at all, I think it got very lucky on a fluke and they did actually improve a lot on the gung-ho shlocky fun vibe in some of the sequels, a few of which I did find to be pretty good bad movies. There's a lot to be said about the B- movie that's actually trying though, and that does have a certain 'pride' in what it's going for, and I did like some of the more enthusiastic actors like the lead guy Finn, out of all the cast he seemed to truly get the tone and use it the most to his advantage, and his character is definitely one of the funnest things about these movies. So is the first Sharknado the so-bad-it's-good fun blast it's made out to be? Uh, not at all, I think it exists in its own idiotic vacuum of easy entertainment for an easily-appeased audience, but it has its good points, and the main one is a certain knowing nod and wink to the proceedings that makes it a little more appealing than the average bad shark TV movie and overall, fans of such cheesy fare could do worse than this one, and it is pretty cool how they turned this silly little movie into a not-inconsiderable franchise that actually managed to keep going for so long - good on ya guys!

I call it a strange flick, mainly due to the fact that it has some sort of strange appeal to the point of spawning five sequels despite none of them having a very high score. I guess it is because people like riffing the films, but these films are a bit too easy to riff as they have so many faults to them. The premise and plot are utterly stupid, the effects aren't very good and most of the characters are very lame...though I did like the old guy and his bar stool. <br/><br/>So the story has a bunch of sharks coming up to the coast of California in record number due to a hurricane that is caused by global warming. Get used to that if you watch other shark films from Asylum, it is their go to cause for everything! Well a dude who runs a bar, a patron, some Australian and a hot waitress end up trying to flee amid sharks dropping from the sky. They go to rescue the bar owner's wife and daughter all while encountering one shark event after another, often times making little sense. Soon they hatch a plan to defeat the tornadoes! Yes, you read that right...<br/><br/>The plot is utter garbage. Sharks falling from the sky that somehow stay alive and still want to eat. I would think they would be severely injured and since they would be suffocating wouldn't be much in the mood for chomping anything. Also, the tornadoes in this film look bad, how hard is it to render a tornado, they did it in Wizard of Oz better than this! I am pretty sure an explosion would not dissipate a tornado and I don't think you could fly a copter that close to one. I am also pretty sure even if that one girl was alive in the shark, the guy launching himself in the shark with a chainsaw straight ahead would have taken her out too. <br/><br/>So maybe I am being too hard on this film, but it is utter crap and they pretty much made it that way. This in turn makes people watch out of morbid curiosity and to riff said film which makes viewers and so they are purposely making bad films which is kind of a smart move, but at the same time it is not the same as riffing a film that is bad, but the filmmakers thought they were making something good.

But, most of the time, the vibe is surprisingly realistic in a fantasy context. Of course you have the typical cartoonish CGI for which movies that debut on Syfy are known. On top of all this is a likable cast, a dynamic pace with consistent thrills/laughs, a rockin' soundtrack and quality score. <br/><br/>Speaking of the cast, Ian Ziering plays the macho male protagonist, Fin, and Cassandra Scerbo his jaw-dropping female counterpart, Nova.

Now our courageous heroes must traverse land, air and sea to overcome their fishy foes and engage in a battle that will determine the fate of mankind.<br/><br/>I don't mean to be sarcastic in the plot overview(well I do but for the sake of credibility). It is just that this movie is, by far the worst movie I have ever laid my eyes on QUALITY wise. As a piece of ENTERTAINMENT, this is the Citizen Kane of entertainment. It is is so far into the depths of 'so bad its good' that is transcends the mini-genre. Nothing in this movie is ever remotely good if you think you're watching a FILM. If you can comprehend you're watching a MOVIE however, you will undoubtedly have a blast watching this with your friends and a LOT of alcohol.<br/><br/>The premise for this movie is the dumbest premise in the entirety of film history. It is so bad but it is also so good at the same time. The plot surrounding this premise is truly awful but I'll be damned if it is not at least entertaining. The last thing you see in this film before the credits is simply the word 'Fin'. That is both the best and worst pun every made. Simultaneously, that signals the coming of the Anti-Christ and the Second Coming of Jewish Christ. I love it! The climax for this movie is pure cinematic genius.*<br/><br/>*If you're under the age of -12<br/><br/>I won't even bother mentioning any actors' names in this movie because they are not worth it. I will say that, to sum up, each and everyone of them were awful in their performance, but should each be retroactively awarded Medals of Bravery for NOT committing suicide during filming.<br/><br/>Now for the technical aspect of this movie. Oh boy, this'll be fun!<br/><br/>The visual effects in this movie are SO bad, they make Jar Jar Binks look like the Cistine Chapel by comparison. ​The cinematographer in this movie must have been a monkey with an iPhone after doing more cocaine in one go than Robert Downey Jr did over the course of several years​. The editor for the movie must have been the cinematographer's distant Kazakhstan cousin with Movie-Maker and enough drugs to supply Snoop Dog for a decade. ​ Even the god damn music makes NO SENSE!<br/><br/>​ This is possibly the worst movie I have ever seen but mark my words, I shall purchase the 4k 3D Copy of this movie and dedicate a shrine where my bed once was. I shall pray to it every night and if you take my advice which is to watch this movie, you will convert to Sharknadism as well.

When one thinks of shark movies, this first movies the first that comes to mind of course is Jaws (1975). One of the biggest critiques of a shark as an antagonist is that the defense is easy: stay out of the water. Sharknado takes that defense away, as natural weather phenomena toss sharks all around Santa Monaco, California making no one safe in the water, on land, and, yes, not even in the air! Everything about this movie is corny. The concept is corny. The acting is awful. There is a forced story line of a divorced father's relationship with his older children. The dialogue is terrible. IMDb lists ""comedy"" as one of the genres of the movie, but honestly I don't think it was intended to be funny; but some of the events that unfold are so absurd you have to laugh. This is pure science fiction, with very little fact. If you are going to watch this and try to point out how the actions wouldn't happen that way, don't bother. Just about every law of physics, chemistry and biology are shattered with this movie, from sharks surviving inside a tornado to the Macgyver-like weaponry they assemble to combat the sharks and the tornadoes. The special effects are better than The Wizard of Oz (1939), but quite laughable as well.

They did a bang-up live show featuring Sharknado and not surprisingly it's hilarious, their constant sarcasm only intensifies the humor-factor of this absurdly stupid and completely over-the-top movie. Why it's just bonkers! Of course they couldn't help themselves (as this IS after all the era of the unnecessary sequel(s) and SYFY Inc. thought somehow the world ""needed"" THREE MORE SHARKNADO'S (with a fifth in the works).

63012345,4 October 2015,"[<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">Just the name Sharknado should bring up a concern to anyone interested in viewing a ""popcorn night"" film. The idiotic thought of a water spout lifting sharks out of the Pacific Ocean and dispersing them in the streets of Los Angeles is a huge red flag for anyone interested in a good film. Surfer Fin (Ian Ziering) and the bar owner attempt to save his friends from the flooding which creates a mystical and an unbelievable occurrence. The scattered use of bad effects, terrible transitions and fictitious scenes make the belief and ability to follow the plot near impossible.<br/><br/>Sharknado has everything but an easy to follow plot. The plot and the ability to follow it, is an extremely major downfall of the film. It starts off with a storm and then all of a sudden the city of L.A. is under water and sharks are preying upon its citizens. As a film viewer, you know that there is going to be something happening in the movie involving sharks of some sort but little do they know the sharks are out to hunt humans in the city of Los Angeles.<br/><br/>The director of the film, David Michael Latt, is known for very low rating and low budget films and his all famous ""mock-busters"". Since the film is a low budget film, drawing in very low revenue, the directors and actors of the film are not as focused on the set, transitions and grabbing the attention of a wide array of audiences as they are with making it completely ridiculous and a movie to watch just because of how completely awful it is.<br/><br/>The least attention grabbing parts of the film are the transitions. The water spouts building out of the fake looking seas, and the fictitious looking sharks, are extremely awful and almost funny to watch. On top of these fictitious features the movie takes place in the actual city of L.A. for a while until all of the bizarre events start to happen. The effects, like the storm and the flooding through the city, and also the fake emotions that the actors try to play, also add more humor to the plot and set, than they do to the actual storyline.<br/><br/>The thought that went into the planning of the events was very clever, however. If someone read the summary of Sharknado, they would be very interested in watching it because the thought of a water spout overtaking a city is pretty thrilling. Also, as terrible as it is, people who are into thrillers would also be attracted to the thought of man hungry sharks, swimming through a flooding, citizen filled city. <br/><br/>Yet again these attractions of this low budget film only draws in a specific type of crowd. Since the crowd type is so limited, it makes gaining attraction a struggle. Especially for a low budget film, the director and cast should focus more on a large group of audience to make up for the fact that the popularity of their film is already very low. <br/><br/>The fact that this movie was intentionally made into a ""mock-buster"" for people to watch just because it is completely ridiculous is shame. Movies, over time, have been a gathering item for families and friends and the fact that Sharknado defies this aspect of cinema, makes it a film that should be off the movie night list.</div>]",2724064

Surprisingly, it is one of their better projects. That said, it is not that good(most of The Asylum's movies are trash anyways from a B movie standard.) The acting in Sharknado is actually decent for something from this company, and the tongue in cheek nature is in proper perspective. This movie is rife with cheese unfortunately they can't make up their minds as to being a cheesefest, or a serious piece. Case in point, the grappling down to the bus scene, why is it there? It does nothing for the plot, is absurd yet not campy, and is a lot of artificial drama that goes nowhere. The flick shifts between serious and comical without any clear idea of what it wants to do.

Our heroes(?) try to escape a series of tornadoes and then turn into something of a rescue squad. <br/><br/>Sharknado, with its intentional badness, has been compared to Plan 9 from Outer Space. In reality, the movies have little in common, because Plan 9 was intended to be a serious movie and turned out laughable. Sharknado, on the other hand, was intended to be bad from the get- go, a clear spoof of Jaws. In that sense, it does to Jaws something like what Airplane! did to the Airport movies, except that it focuses on intentional putridity rather than solely getting as many laughs as possible. There are also many moments of tacky and even hilarious gory violence, cliff-hangers and narrow escapes.<br/><br/>What to say? It is a simple fact that there are many of us willing to be entertained by sheer silliness. I do not think this is a bad thing, if it is done well, and in fact this movie does it very well. In this sense, it is not a bad movie--it accomplishes something, after all. The movie also got more effective as it went along, as the Jaws jokes really got going.

It reminded me a lot to Zombieland, because both have the same sense of humor and insanity. I dare to say that Sharknado is the most hilarious horror-comedy since Zombieland. Even though some scares and deaths were very predictable, I still enjoyed this flick. It is great to watch a film that knows what it is doing and does it well.<br/><br/>Tara Reid is probably one of the worst actresses in recent memory, she sucked in this movie. But that was the point, right? Sharknado is awfully good and I do not know if that makes sense to you. In addition, Ian Ziering was amazing, he was a badass in this film. Also, the direction was interesting, especially in its final 10 minutes, there was a strangely awesome moment that blew my mind. In conclusion, the first half was somewhat boring and predictable, but the second half was bloody-fun, unpredictable and highly entertaining. I liked it. (B-)</div>]",2724064

You don't have to be a genius to realize that a film titled Sharknado will be ridiculously over the top. I was in the mood for a terrible B-movie like this and was hoping to get over the top performances with terrible dialogues and laughable CGI effects. Sharknado delivered everything I was looking for and more. Why would I want to watch something like this you may ask. The answer is simple: for pure nostalgic reasons. In the 90's I remember we would get together with a few friends and choose several films that looked so terrible we could have a fun time watching them and making fun of the performances. That was an experience I was trying to relive again and Sharknado fulfilled my expectations. I think I laughed harder than I did with any other comedy this year. Sharknado will be a classic for people like my group of friends that simply want to get together to make fun of how terrible a film is. This is probably the most hysterical SyFy monster film that will ever be made. Despite all this, there is no way I could recommend this film considering it is terrible and defies all the physics and natural laws that exist. I still had a blast with this shameless and brainless 90 minute film, but it's just terrible and one of the worst films of 2013.<br/><br/>Fin Shepard (Ian Ziering) is a former Surf champ who currently owns a bar near the Santa Monica Pier. When a hurricane threatens to flood the region bringing in thousands of sharks near the beach coast, Fin sets out with his good friend Baz (Jaason Simmons) and the waitress who works for him, Nova (Cassandra Scerbo) to rescue his ex wife, April (Tara Reid), and his teen daughter, Chloe (Aubry Peebles). Along the way they will have to face menacing sharks who have made their way into the city through floods and tornados. If you thought you could be safe from sharks in land, Sharknado teaches you otherwise. Not even the skies are safe.<br/><br/>Directed by Anthony Ferrante, Sharknado has seemed to find an audience, and a sequel is already in the works. The hysterical screenplay was written by Thunder Levin, and you have to give it up for these two guys for the nonsensical inventiveness they had here. Not only do they include natural disasters like tornados, but they add starving and angry sharks to the mix. The effects in this film are probably the worst you will see from a modern movie. Sharknado knows it's a bad film and simply plays with its audience. I heard someone complaining about Nova who was ashamed of her scars, but wore shorts all the time. Of course she does, that is the whole point of these films where they go completely over the top so you and your friends can point out everything that is wrong with it. John Heard has a pretty funny supporting performance, while the rest of the cast simply play their part without glory.</div>]",2724064

It's really terrible full of unbelievable situations and bad CGI and still I keep watching SyFy stuff just for the stupidity.<br/><br/>This time a big storm is coming towards Los Angeles. Some kind of tornado but hey, just have a closer look. The tornado comes from over the ocean and did pick up the creatures from the sea, the bad ones, the sharks. They are all over LA and are killing what comes in their way. The first attack is on Santa Monica Pier. We do see the CGI tornado coming but when they show a overview of the pier you can see the sunshine and a calm ocean. And that's what I noticed the most, bad editing full of mistakes. Even the acting wasn't what it should be. But again the editing made it sometimes ridiculous. You see that for example at the bar everybody is waiting for their line which shows in the way it was edited. <br/><br/>What's funny is are the issues that the father is having with his family. I won't go into detail but they are trying to add some emotions throughout the sharknado so that you are going to be involved with the characters, sadly it doesn't. <br/><br/>Towards the end once the chopper comes in this is a must see, with a normal gun shooting sharks from the sky to rescue the chopper, really...and from that point it's over the top. Stopping tornado's with bombs??<br/><br/>Seeing is believing, killing sharks with a chair and a pool stick.

46670824,18 November 2013,"[<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">I first heard about this movie from the Nostalgia Critic, so I guess I cheated a little in that I knew what to expect before I watched the actual film. This is one of those low-budget schlock films that SyFy loves to churn out that we love to hate. Additionally, this movie was distributed by The Asylum, a no-budget movie studio dedicated to producing rip-offs of blockbuster movies such as Transformers, Sherlock Holmes, Jurassic Park, King Kong, etc. Put them together and you get terrible acting, horrible computer animation, inconsistent shots, a story so stupid you'll lose a dozen IQ points watching it, and a LOT OF FUN! It's one of those movies so bad, you have no choice but to admit it's good!<br/><br/>The story is what the title suggests: A tornado picks up several thousand sharks that were conveniently all swimming in one place and wastes no time in heading toward Los Angeles and spitting them all over the city. These sharks are apparently super sharks as they're not killed by being thrown hundreds of miles per hour and smashing into cars, buildings, streets, etc. and instead chomp down on whatever they land on, even if it's bigger than what a shark stomach can contain. In the middle of all this, bar-owner Fin(get it?) sets out with his friends Nova and Baz to rescue his wife and stop the tornado from destroying the city with the sushi storm of the century! ...Sounds completely stupid? I'm not even going to tell you how they plan to stop the tornado...<br/><br/>The acting is extremely wooden, as if all the actors showed up on set one day and all the direction they were given was ""You're this person, act like this person as best as you can."" As a result, we have drunks with stereotypical slurred speech, people who stare blankly and emotionless as sharks chow down on their surroundings, and the most Tara Reid we've even gotten out of Tara Reid... Nobody's winning any Oscars anytime soon, that's for sure...<br/><br/>The effects. ...Wow, words can't describe how bad they are. The Dire Straits ""Money For Nothing"" music video would be pointing and laughing at how cheesy the CGI is. The sharks that appear in this movie make every appearance of Jaws look like a SeaWorld live show. If you hit the Delete button on a game of Warcraft II, it'll provide a better house demolition scene than what this movie shows us... Additionally, a very large storm is supposed to be occurring throughout the state, yet we constantly get shots of sunny weather and clear skies, even when sharks are raining down on our heroes! When there's blood, we have the choice of either a brief and fake CGI blood splash or blood pack gushing out several gallons of blood a second. In other words, we have all the cheap corner cutters modern schlock films are famous for.<br/><br/>Now with that said, this movie is AWESOME!<br/><br/>It's an Asylum/SyFy collaboration movie, so you're not exactly expecting Citizen Kane. It piles on the cheesiness and cheapness so much, you'll be pointing and laughing throughout the movie. ""Oh wow, I didn't know you could light water on fire!"" ""Whoops! Hollywood killed him!"" ""Look out! Sharks are swimming in water that barely reaches the heroes' ankles!"" The action scenes, though as cheap as the rest of the movie, are probably the best parts. Any movie with a scene where a guy holds out a chainsaw and slices a shark speeding right at him in half definitely has something going for it! It's cheesy, it's corny, it's schlock, it's whatever term you use to describe cheap-o movies, and it's the perfect movie for you and your friends to gather and laugh your butts off at. So pull up a chair, grab a few six-packs, invite a dozen of your friends, and enjoy what is arguably the best low-budget cheese you'll see this year!</div>]",2724064

The amount of creativity and artistic/realistic license is simply staggering. I am genuinely wondering if they left enough good ideas for the inescapable sequel, Sharknado 2: The Second One.<br/><br/>An estimated one-third of the movie seems to consist of archive footage which has been heavily (and poorly) photoshopped with added sharks, vehicles and thunderstorms, showing again what a motivated filmmaker and widely available software can do. Another third consists of actors (well, some at least make an effort) inside a car having laughable dialog in order to put in some drama: the dad who didn't give his family proper attention, the traumatized girl, etc. The final third is made up of action scenes, that is to say, often badly edited close-ups shots to hide that most stuff was shot separately in the hope that coherent scenes could be made from them. However, there are some really good over-the-top scenes that manage to stretch the imagination quite a bit.<br/><br/>All in all, this is quite an amusing shark-fest for the aficionado.

This film is perfect example for that, it is a crazy storyline that comes off ridiculously entertaining. It's not difficult to pick up its just simply sharks in tornadoes and a group of people trying to outrun them and save the city before it gets completely overrun. It is full of entertaining characters that other disaster films fail to create and by doing this you really don't know who will get pick off next. Watch it as a fun film and you will enjoy. (7/10)<br/><br/>Actor Review<br/><br/>Ian Ziering: Fin champion surfer and bar owner who leads a group of survivors across the city to save his family, he knows how to predict the waves and counter sharks attacks. Good lead performance who lets the rest of the characters feed of his ideas. (7/10)<br/><br/>Tara Reid: April Fin's ex-wife who wants to keep him away from his family as she believes he is a let-down, but soon tags along for the ride being the downer character. Let's face it Tara isn't the best actress around and this performance shows why. (4/10)<br/><br/>John Heard: George a regular in Fin's bar who leaves with his favourite bar stool, which turns into his weapon of choice against the sharks. He gets some funny lines in during his short spell with the group. (7/10)<br/><br/>Cassandra Scerbo: Nova one of Fin's employees at the bar who also has a crush on him, when the sharks start to attack Nova is the one who kicks all their asses. Good performance turning what looks like an innocent naïve girl into a kick ass scene stealer. (8/10)<br/><br/>Jaason Simmons: Baz a friend of Fin's who joins on the adventure, he is also a surfer and full of one liners. Good supporting performance offering a lot of comic relief. (7/10)<br/><br/>Director Review: Anthony C. Ferrante – Turns a barmy idea into one of the most entertaining films to date a full blown sit down enjoy film.

41699214,28 July 2014,"[<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">So about a half hour into this movie I realized why I hated so much. The movie comes to us a campy homage to Roger Corman B-movies of the 50s and 60s. In that respect, it works for maybe five or six minutes. Then my straight up anger at this film grew and grew until I knew that it was not because of the straight up ludicrousness of everything about it. I can get behind that. What I can't get behind was how intentional it is. I mean, lets examine it. Sharknado is about a massive hurricane that some how triggers waterspouts that lift up sharks and then deposit them in L A. That's about all you need to know, because thats about all the movie seems to know. I can imagine the meeting were it was pitched, and that is about all the writer must have said. And some producer remembered Corman pictures and Jaws, and decided that it was a good idea to make this movie, but to try and make it as poorly as possible. Well, congratulations, you succeeded. If we forget the ridiculous premise, it is still a completely terrible movie. Poorly written, acted and filmed. The effects are laughable, but not in the good, guilty pleasure way of those in Plan 9 From Outer Space. They are not like the hubcaps with string and dry ice, or the hundreds of plastic and rubber beasts that were made for the worser B-movies. They are so deliberate. There is nothing endearing about them. They are a blatant reminder that you are watching a movie that prides itself on its terribleness, which of course defeats the point. The actors take their roles with deadly seriousness, so there is none of the fun that comes with Adam West/Burt Ward Batman. There is no winking to audience by anyone involved. Just the feeling that you are watching a movie made by people who forget that nobody intends to make a bad movie. Even the creators of terrible, laughable trash at least had the artistry to make the best movie that they could. No such luck here. I was struck with the phoniness of it all, and I saw a film that has no idea why bad movies are loved in cult circles. It's because they didn't want to be bad. Sharknado does, and it ends up like a child screaming for attention. It is just as annoying to be near as the child is. So, to recap: you want a bad movie you have one. You want a movie that is made by people who have no idea what makes bad movies good, you got one. You want a movie that could inspire spirited discussion about camp, poor taste and standards in film, you got one. You want to have any fun, you don't have you movie for tonight.</div>]",2724064

22513682,21 September 2013,"[<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">In 1975, Steven Spielberg gave us Jaws, which wasn't the first killer shark movie but it's still remembered as the best ever. This year, the Asylum gave us Sharknado, a movie so ridiculous it's been talked about for months now. In its own, bad way, Sharknado pays homage to Jaws in several scenes – which does absolutely nothing to redeem this movie's quality. The critics on Rotten Tomatoes are, apparently, thrilled by Sharknado, judging by the high rating it's got. But again, this isn't a good movie, and you need to arm yourself with an empty brain and a lot of patience to sit through this horror and enjoy it.<br/><br/>Since the tagline for this movie is ""Enough said!"", I suppose there's no need to specify what Sharknado is about: a hurricane hits Los Angeles and causes water tornadoes that carry sharks in them. These sharks then fall on the ground and eat people. A group of friends must escape the floods and save the city before everyone is eaten by sharks. So far, nothing too innovative or clever. But the way all is done is amazingly horrid. A good example would be the opening scene: a captain and an Asian man are discussing business on a boat. The Asian wants to buy shark fins, and the captain hunts sharks illegally. After they've sealed the deal, the Asian man tries to escape without paying. They're still on a boat, in the middle of the sea.<br/><br/>Apart from nonsensical plot developments, the bad acting is worth mentioning. And yes, this is a Z-movie, therefore bad acting is expected, if not a must, but this – you really have to see it to believe it. Then there's the awful, cheesy dialogue, unsuccessfully trying to establish relations and emotions among dull characters. For example, Nova (Cassie Scerbo) is supposed to be in love with our main character, Fin (Ian Ziering), who thinks he's too old for her – but all I see is a horny young girl and a man so indifferent to everything it's like he's made of cardboard. All these people are just thrown in the movie to create the illusion of a story, and of something happening.<br/><br/>How can one forget the many continuity errors? In one scene there's a raging storm tearing houses apart, and in the next, the same location is sunny. Then we see our heroes driving through what is supposed to be 30 cm of water, but in the next shot the roads are barely wet. Besides, how can cars, in general, possibly drive through so much water? They can't actually, only our heroes' car can. Also, the water is so high sharks can swim around their car – and they're still able to drive. Finally, what would this movie be without dreadful, Birdemic-like CGI? It wouldn't be an Asylum, for sure! Let's add, to all of this, the fact that Sharknado gets extremely boring and you get a perfect 'must never see' movie, whose only redeeming qualities are the occasional so-bad- you-must-laugh scenes.<br/><br/>Rating: 2/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/</div>]",2724064

Ian Ziering shooting sharks falling from the sky (and taking them out with one shot from a pistol) as well as Tara Reid kicking a chainsaw to him in slowmo and sawing a shark in half while jumping at it (when it was just 40 feet above their heads 15 seconds earlier) is priceless! If that sounds entertaining to you than you're sure to at least be amused by this disaster film about a hurricane that pulls sharks out of the ocean and drops them down on Los Angeles through waterspouts (and floods the streets with them). <br/><br/>The film was distributed by The Asylum Studio, directed by Anthony C. Ferrante and written by Thunder Levin. It stars Ian Ziering as a surfing bar-owner who fights to save his ex-wife (Tara Reid) and teenage daughter (Aubrey Peeples) and adult son (Chuck Hittinger) from killer sharks roaming the streets of Los Angeles (during the freak storm). He has help from his surfer buddy (Jason Simmons) and lead bartender (Cassie Scerbo). John Heard also co-stars as a drunk bar regular.<br/><br/>The film debuted to 1.37 million views (which is below the average, 1.5 million, for a Syfy Network original film). Then it shot up to 1.89 million views on it's second airing, a week after it's premier, due to massive internet hype (especially on Twitter) from the likes of screenwriter Damon Lindelof and actors Wil Wheaton and Cory Monteith (of 'GLEE' fame, shortly before he died of a drug overdose). The film then scored another 2.1 million views on it's third airing (9 days after it's first encore presentation) and is now planned for a limited theatrical run. Does the movie deserve to be a viral sensation? Maybe not but I still had a blast watching it and I can admit that. At first I was only going to give it 0 to 1 stars, due to how bad it really is and Tara Reid has never looked worse (but Scerbo is totally hot in the movie). After reexamining it and realizing how entertaining it really is though I decided to compromise with myself and give it an average rating of 2.5 stars (out of 5).

Ferrante gets into the swing of things and kicks the action up a notch or two, turning his film from a 'hell no!' to a 'why the hell not?'.<br/><br/>Once the sharks start flying through the air, sucked up in water spouts that are trashing Hollywood, the fun really begins, with lots of cheap but enthusiastic gore as the CGI fish fall from the sky to sink their jaws into numerous victims. Fighting back with shotgun and chainsaw, our survivors ensure that things get very messy indeed.<br/><br/>5/10, plus one point for the very lovely Cassandra Scerbo as sexy barmaid Nova, minus one point for having Nova eaten by a shark, but plus one more point for having her miraculously pulled out of the shark alive and unharmed at the end.</div>]",2724064
35309124,30 July 2016,"[<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">""Sharknado"" is just an awful film. It serves no purpose as a film because it isn't entertaining; not funny, not interesting, and certainly not scary. There are some good characters in it, and the acting isn't totally awful, but the writing is. <br/><br/>""Sharknado"" is also very, very poorly put together in the departments of editing, colorization, and cinematography. The film is FULL of stock footage of sharks and extreme weather events (likely bought from professionals and TV news stations). The stock footage is just ""copy &amp; pasted"" right into the film's actual footage, and to the worst effect. The two are mixed together so horribly. It's as if ""Sharknado"" was never properly edited for color and other aspects so to make the transitions seem even a little bit smooth. Watching this film is like flipping between nature shows about sharks &amp; extreme weather and a daytime TV soap opera. To cap it all off, there are so many old &amp; outdated special effects used in this film; stuff from the 40's &amp; 50's (like old Westerns) such as speeding-up the film to make a car seem like it's traveling faster than it really is, and many other faux-pas that are so beyond what is possible in 2013.<br/><br/>I know you're probably thinking, ""Brandon, it's a show about a 'Sharknado', what do you want!? It's not going to be a masterpiece!"" But it really could've been made entertaining; the budget was certainly high enough. There are some SyFy-made films that are--at least--funny and/or entertaining. This is simply not one of them.<br/><br/>3 out of 10 stars because the concept is funny, but the execution is despicable. It's positively awful. If you're thinking of watching this in order to ""catch up"" with the series so you know what's happening in the newest sequel ""Sharknado 4"", don't even bother.

No one is safe!! The film shows the main hero, an alpha male/everyman that runs a beachside bar fighting for his and his families life. There's some emotional conflict and melodrama in between, but mostly this film consists of brutal, crazy and extremely unrealistic scenes of camp action/horror, that luckily aren't overly tasteless or gruesome, but do give the impression that the filmmakers dig trash cinema, irony and absurdity in equal measure.<br/><br/>The problem with the film is this: its not very good. On a filmmaking level, I mean. Have you ever seen those Youtube tutorials on how to do something ""awesome"" with your digital video footage? Well, that's pretty much what happens in this film. Every shot is caked over with out-of-the-box color grading presets, out-of-the-box CGI blood, lighting and explosion effects, extremely crude matte painting and compositing and loads of CGI sharks that look pretty cool, but are noticeably fake in a handful of scenes. <br/><br/>In a sense, it doesn't matter, because the films action/horror premise is a goof and its clearly set in the realm of fantasy. No one is expecting to see a real live shark crashing about in four feet of water in an L.A. living room, but overall this movie plays like a 90 minute demo reel of cheap visual effects ideas lifted from Youtube.

I feel compelled to write a little bit about just how horrific and eye abortion-inducing this pair of movies is. If you have not seen them...you must...with the caveat that you will never have the 86 minutes you spent of your life on each back.<br/><br/>The cinematic and acting brilliance that was on display along with the most amazing intellectual conclusions are stunning. I learned so much! Let's start with Sharknado: 1. E5 Tornados can form out of no clouds in the middle of a city for no reason what so ever and will not destroy buildings.<br/><br/>2. Sharks breathe out of water and when picked up by tornadoes only care about eating people.<br/><br/>3. It can be simulateously sunny and rainy.<br/><br/>4. There can be ocean flooding inside a home in the mountains outside Los Angeles while the ground outside is dry.<br/><br/>5. Helicopters are impervious to tornado winds.<br/><br/>6. Homemade bombs from propane tanks will stop tornadoes if dropped into them from a helicopter.<br/><br/>7. Los Angeles citizens do not care about tornadoes or sharks dropping from the sky and will even swim in the pool while a once in history hurricane is bearing down upon them.<br/><br/>8. A person can survive in the stomach of a shark that has swallowed them in the air during a tornado for over 30 minutes.<br/><br/>My knowledge was enhanced further in Sharknado 2: 9. Blizzards dumping 24 inches of snow can occur in July without any snow on the ground or snow falling from the skies and without any cold as evidenced by New Yorkers wearing short-sleeved shirts.<br/><br/>10. Shea Stadium is a magnet for sharks falling from the sky.<br/><br/>11. Weather forecasters can predict sharks falling from the sky at a rate of 2 inches per minute.<br/><br/>12. Sharks on fire can climb down 60 flights of stairs.<br/><br/>13. Monster storms can occur without wind, snow, rain, or any change in the weather.<br/><br/>14. If your arm is bitten off by a shark while on an airplane, you can be up and around in under 12 hours as long as you tie a saw to the end of your stump.<br/><br/>15. Flooding of 5 stories in a building can occur without the carpet on the first floor getting wet.</div>]",2724064

As the seasons passed they started getting letters from film students offering to intentionally make bad movies for the crew to review since being made fun of on the show would actually boost their chances of making it in Hollywood. I get the impression that the people behind Sharknado were hoping to attract the attention of the MST3k crew who have moved on to doing Rifftrax. It's the only explanation that makes sense. This movie is so badly written, acted, directed, with such immensely bad not-so-special effects that it has to be on purpose.</div>]",2724064
55985867,24 October 2014,"[<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">Whenever Sharknado is shown on TV, thousands of sharks die from humiliation. Director Anthony C. Ferrante and writer Thunder Levin obviously didn't care about this movie and didn't have the time to think. At all. In hindsight, the only reason I watched this movie was to laugh! In its description, Sharknado is categorized as a horror... More like a comedy. There is so much wrong with this movie's plot, setting, and ﬁlm cutting. Amazingly enough, this movie was nominated for the People's Choice Award. OK, I can believe this, only if it's the choice to burn all copies and throw the ashes into the ﬁery depths of the devil's land. <br/><br/>Consequently, neither the director or the writer took the time to look up facts. What for? Well, maybe the fact that it is nearly impossible for sharks to be pulled into a hurricane, let alone survive one. Looking back on this movie and all of its idiocies, the dead bodies of sharks falling from the sky actually seems reasonable. Alright, so let's say that just by chance, a hurricane somehow forms in the cold Paciﬁc Ocean right off the coast of Los Angeles. Then, by chance, hundreds of sharks just happen to swim towards the hurricane willingly, calmly getting sucked up, just to be spun around in circles for hours while they get to the coast. If all of that happened, most of them would be dead within the ﬁrst 10 minutes of spinning. Most hurricanes spin at a good pace but this was a big one. The winds were probably around 120mph, if people can survive a small hurricane, I don't think sharks can survive a huge one. Somehow surviving the spinning death, the sharks make it to land, just to have the sudden urge to kill people. OK, so maybe some sharks would kill a person, but the average death by shark per year for people is one. Yes, one. That's .083 people per month, .0276 per week, and .003857 people per day. And that's the maximum. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, in the background of this movie, LA changes from wrecked and crumbling to sunny and beautiful. But looking at the big picture, there is a 1 in 10,000 chance of a hurricane hitting Southern California. Why? The waters are too cold, the wind isn't right, and the currents make it almost impossible. The needed temperature of the water for a hurricane to shape is 80°F. In Southern California, the peak is about 75°F; that's pushing it. Generally speaking, the ocean there is usually about 60°F off the coast. So now. Let's say that a hurricane does form, now the winds will slice it up, making the hurricane lose its shape and fall back into the water. The prevailing northwestern wind pushes warmer water offshore, bringing up the cold water underneath. <br/><br/>In its favor, Sharknado is entertaining. Usually, this would be a good thing but, looking at the description, this is a horror movie. Looking at the reviews, people are ""disappointed"" and say that it's a ""complete waste of time, stupid from the beginning."" The rating for this movie is 3.3. OK, that's alright if it's out of 5. But, in this rating, it is out of 10! <br/><br/>Additionally, the facts and physics in this movie is all wrong. First of all, sharks can't steer in the air. The producer must have thought that they can swim in the sea, so of course they can swim in the air, right? Wrong. The force of a shark coming down from hundreds of feet in the air would kill someone, even if they were holding a chainsaw. OK, I'll be honest. These are magical chainsaws that were built just to cut ﬂying sharks in two as they are shooting towards you at hundreds of miles per hour. OK, no, that's not right, but let's look at when one of the characters gets eaten by a shark. Alright, so he gets swallowed when he's in a helicopter, then he falls in the dead shark all the way to the ground. If he survived that, who knows what would happen.. Or maybe they do know. So, he gets to the ground, then everyone gathers around the shark. Then, somehow, he turns on his chainsaw and cuts his way out. There is no room to breath inside a shark, let alone turn on a chainsaw. <br/><br/>In conclusion, Sharknado is a horrible movie. From this movie being produced, the death rates have doubled, if not tripled for humans and sharks alike. This movie gave twelve people cancer and three Ebola. If your friends or family ever want to watch this movie, tackle them and show this to them. Do not let anyone see this. There have already been enough deaths since it had been released in 2013. The sharks are dying. The people are dying. Save humanity. Stay away from Sharknado.</div>]",2724064

23483288,18 July 2013,"[<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">I feel that on a serious level, the level in which I try and review all the films I watch, Sharknado cannot be reviewed. It's the anomaly of cinema, an idea that is so preposterous and inconceivable that the only appropriate responses are to watch, laugh, and make smarmy commentary. There's almost no room for genuine criticism and thought on this film that isn't drummed up on the second. I almost feel a live commentary review is in order. It has been roughly ten hours since I watched Sharknado; I think I am late to formally review it by ten hours.<br/><br/>The film focuses on Los Angeles, which during an enormous hurricane is greeted by a large, astronomically destructive tornado that extracts sharks from the ocean and drops them freely in the streets of the city. Now, a group of residents, lead by Fin (Ian Ziering) after his bar is destroyed by the beasts, are forced to use obscure and creative ways to take out the tornado before the entire town is demolished by free-flying sharks.<br/><br/>Unlike many people who discovered Sharknado due to its popularity on social networks the night the SyFy channel premiered it, I knew of it when it was on sale at Cannes Film Festival, alongside other winners such as Copposites, a South African buddy-cop movie and Wiener Dog Nationals, the Beverly Hills Chihuahua of wiener dog movies. As consistent readers know, I can appreciate good, silly movies when they clearly have a sense of fun and earnestness about their production. Sharknado, however, feels cold in this department. Nothing about it feels genuinely silly, as if the filmmakers gathered in a room and decided they needed to make a film that effectively took the most asinine idea proposed and made it into a movie.<br/><br/>Take some of the proclaimed ""dumb"" films that I like on a level more than stupid filmmaking: Maximum Overdrive, the horror film Jack Frost, The Gingerdead Man, and the onslaught of Tremors sequels. Those films worked because they took their idea and ran with it in such a way that it felt the people behind them were seriously attempting a good film that possessed a laughable idea. Sharknado, on the other hand, continues to show you how dumb its idea is and almost never feels as if it wants to work as something other than purposefully bad entertainment. When you take an idea as idiotic as Sharknado's and coddle it to the point where you no longer want to pass it off as something silly but functional, there's nothing more to be seen than a piece of filmmaking that has a great idea and simply doesn't try. The fun wears off when you get past the fact that the film's disaster at hand is a hurricane that formed a tornado that has the ability to drop sharks on the ground below.<br/><br/>The acting and the writing are predictably atrocious, to the point where we can only hope everyone involved was just joking around. For example, the water in a flooded house becomes dark red after a shark just died. A character naturally replies, ""must be that time of the month."" Another features a guy and a girl talking when the girl mentions, ""sharks killed my grandpa. That's why I hate them."" The guy can only reply with, ""now I hate sharks too."" The film was made by the company ""Asylum,"" which is infamous for its ""mockbuster"" films, also known as films that parody a box office hit that are strategically planned to hit DVD right as the film it's parodying releasing in theaters. Most recently, they've raised Pacific Rim with Atlantic Rim and undoubtedly made some confuse Thor, the 2011 superhero film, with their Almighty Thor. Sharknado is another entry in their long line of stunningly ridiculous creature features, right up there with Mega Piranha and Mega Shark Versus Crocosaurus. Again, these are films that bank off of a simple idea that is stretched out to capacity at ninety-minutes or so, making them effectively boring and tedious after the first half hour or so.<br/><br/>Regardless, Sharknado has obviously done something right, whether it's use media to heavily advertise itself, stamp ""Enough Said!"" on the cover in an attempt to show there's not much else mentally taxing to understand about the idea, and even greenlight a sequel immediately after it became a Twitter-sensation and host a contest on what the subtitle should be. It's only logical to not that there will be an inspired legion of people who regard this as one of the greatest low-budget cinematic achievements in recent years and they may not be wrong. The film, in my eyes, though, is redundant and tiresome. There's just something unremarkable about a film that is self-aware to almost everything it does and every move it makes that it renders the entire ""so bad it's good"" experience moot and almost entirely ineffective.<br/><br/>Starring: Tara Reid, Ian Ziering, John Heard, Cassie Scerbo, and Jaason Simmons.

1214734,25 May 2014,"[<div class=""text show-more__control"">The Normal Heart is powerful emotional film about the early days of the AIDS crisis. While the characters are fictionalized, the events and the struggles are all too real. The film provides a valuable history lesson for those too young to remember the politics and emotions of the early days of the AIDS epidemic. The film dramatizes the criminal neglect of both the Reagan administration and Ed Koch's administration in New York City. It shows the complexity of the struggles within the gay community as they tried to come to grips with an epidemic while still trying to challenge a culture that barely acknowledged their existence. In many ways, the film dramatizes just how far we have come and still suggests that we have a long way to go. Some scenes are simply heart-breaking. The film is well-acted particularly by Mark Ruffalo, Matt Bomer, Alfred Molina and Julia Roberts. HBO has shown again that it is in the forefront of bringing socially conscious drama to the screen and for that they should be commended.

Dramatization of events, with Mark Ruffalo's screenwriter Ned Weeks substituting for Kramer, is necessarily a no-holds-barred examination of gay sex in the '80s and its consequences, with the gay community themselves their own worst enemy (by being asked to abstain in the wake of more information on the disease, they felt oppressed as a modern culture and rebelled). In spite of an agonizingly long gestation period for this material (which Barbra Streisand optioned years ago, but was unable to finance), director Ryan Murphy has crafted an immediate and powerful document, alternately angry, sexy, tough, moving and thoughtful. Though ""Longtime Companion"" and the cable-film ""And The Band Played On"" have covered the AIDS epidemic (and done it extremely well), that does not lessen the impact of this HBO film, which packs an emotional wallop.

38211023,3 June 2014,"[<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">I'm haunted by memories of gay friends dying in 80's when getting AIDs was a death sentence and no one seemed to care. My boyfriend's brother was one of those Fire Island boys who was so convincingly played by Mark Ruffalo (Ned Weeks). I know Mark as a comedian, but he so captured the anger that must have been felt by so many gay men who's lovers were dying and they could do nothing to stop it, no matter how much money they had. As for Matt Bomer (Felix Turner), I have to say I think he deserves an academy award for his transformation from the handsome dashing man he is, to the gaunt shadow of a figure he became due to his role's AIDs illness. What a real acting force he has become, and this role shows he is so much more than just a handsome face. Also well played was Julia Roberts depiction of Dr. Emma Brookner (Dr. Linda Laubenstein in real life who's unfunded research helped so many), Jim Parsons warm loving portrayal of character Tommy Boatwright who was the heart of the movie and showed the warmth and caring of most gay men I've known, and Taylor Kitsch portrayal of Bruce Niles which showed the reality of Gay men of that era, who feared having their sexual identity out in the public eye with all the negative consequences (harassment, job discrimination, loss of family) of that.<br/><br/>This is a story that people definitely need to see, to understand how this disease spread unchecked for so long. If not for the efforts of men like Ned Weeks and the Gay Activist Alliance's efforts get funding for research when no public official would even acknowledge there was a problem, who know how many more people have died and would be dying today. This is an angry gritty movie, that doesn't hold back from telling it how it was. It's also a heartbreaking story of how people treat others who are outwardly different yet inwardly the same as themselves. Which is why, whether you're gay or straight, you can relate to the sad love story told here, and the heroism of those who fought the battle to find a way to stop the deaths devastating their community. It's shockingly true that our government let this epidemic get out of control and until deaths started affecting the heterosexual community, and famous people (like Rock Hudson) did nothing to stop its rampage.</div>]",1684226

In these very early years the disease was still searching for a name and it was known only as a gay disease. After death after death a newspaper reporter Ned Weeks(in a super performance from Mark Ruffalo)starts to become an activist and fight for the rights of gay men and he faces a big climb from the political and medical community who both seem in denial of gay men's rights and they have no clue on how to treat the disease. Ned sees the pain and toll that it takes as his lover Felix(Matt Bomer)falls to defeat in the end from this new mysterious killer of gay men. In an outstanding performance veteran Julia Roberts is high strong and determined as a polio stricken doctor Brookner who was one of the first in the country to treat gay men for this disease. She has hope and fights for change. Overall this film is a painful watch about life, love, and in the end death still it's message is it's okay to fight for life and equal justice even if your different and love one of your own gender.

You could feel his performance, every mood of it (and believe me it runs through all of them). Mark's ability to transform into a gay man (at a time in gay history that was so scary and unimaginable) with such believability was amazing. I forgot I was watching Mark Ruffalo, his performance completely erased his own being.<br/><br/>There are many aspects of the film that critics are tearing into. Critics who were not even alive at the time opinion's on the subject are worthless in my view, but for those critics who have long ago left their pacifiers at home I can agree with some of the negatives.<br/><br/>The film showed only a segment of the gay population living in NYC at that time, primarily the rich A listers who were never political before AIDS and only became so when their own lives were in danger. The majority of gay men did not spend sex filled weekends on Fire island in expensive beach houses. They were working men of all races and incomes who because of their financial circumstances, lack of insurance etc died quickly and with little notice outside their friends and family, if they were lucky enough to have a family that accepted them (remember this was 1981 not 2014).<br/><br/>This film brought back a lot of sadness and regrets for me, I wanted to hug Ned Weeks and tell him that things do get better in the future. It's not often that a performance affects me, but Ruffalo's did, not because he was playing a fictionalized version of a real person, but because he was playing a little bit of a lot of different men, who at the time thought the promised land had finally arrived for gay men and only to see it turn into a Holocast right before their eyes.<br/><br/>I hope that Mark is nominated and wins an Emmy for his performance, because he deserves it.</div>]",1684226

It has touched my life personally as well, as I had a few friends diagnosed in the 90's and it is something that has always put fear in my heart. With the education and knowledge surrounding the disease now though we are a lot further advanced when it comes to how to handle those who have caught or are living with the dreaded disease. One thing we have never seen before though is the brutality that came with it, especially when it was first discovered. The Normal Heart is a work of fiction bought to life as a TV movie by the same writer who penned the stage version in 1985 Larry Kramer, add to the mix TV director Ryan Murphy of Glee and American Horror Story fame and the two bring forth a film version of the play.<br/><br/>Summer of 1981, Ned Weeks is a loud opinionated outspoken New York writer who arrives at Fire Island to celebrate the birthday of his long-time friend Mike's partner Craig. Ned is an openly gay guy which is almost unheard of amongst his social groups, most of his friends are closeted for family or work reason, the party is filled with guys he has known throughout the years. Ned's friend Micky who is dating Craig decide to go for a walk along the beach suddenly Craig feels dizzy and collapses. Later in the afternoon Craig is ready to blow out his birthday candles and suddenly begins to cough uncontrollably. Back in New York City Ned after reading an article about the new disease that seems to be killing off gay men meets up with Dr Emma Brookner who is doing her best to raise awareness about this new disease that only appears to be affecting the gay men of New York. Ned organises a gathering at his home and invites every gay man he can to help educate them and spread the word. From the meeting, Ned and a few friends form a Community Group calling themselves Gay Men's Health Crisis (GMHC) where they help other men who are suffering or know of others suffering with a call centre and general advice<br/><br/>The performances from this TV movie are outstanding, Ned Weeks is a man you loathe due to his arrogance and loud mouth but he is played brilliantly by Mark Ruffalo (The Avengers, Eternal Sunshine of The Spotless Mind) Matt Bomer's (White Collar, In Time) transformation has to be seen to be believed as his body slowly deteriorates within the three years the film takes place over. With one of her finest performances to date in my opinion Julia Roberts (Pretty Woman, Eat Pray Love) excels as Dr Emma Brookner. Also starring Jim Parsons, Alfred Molina, Taylor Kitsch and a whole heap of others. I felt the performances by everyone were amazing, a rare opportunity to say the cast was chosen perfectly. Ryan Murphy has done a great job with the film, nothing too fancy more letting the actors star and deliver their lines the way it should be.<br/><br/>It's a very heavy film; some scenes are very distressing and no doubt most will need the tissues handy.

632863,16 September 2014,"[<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">There are movies made that people just need to see. They are enlightened, insightful and work with hard issues that some people don't want to deal with in their regular life. Most of the time they are dramas, but it makes sense. People don't want to stylize hard issues that would end up making something offensive. That offensive nature would go farther than the actual issue that people should be talking about. I'll be the first to say I usually avoid ""movies with a message"" unless they appeal to me somehow. Or if it's a movie that must be seen.<br/><br/>The Normal Heart is that movie that must be seen not just by the gay male community but everyone. It hits hard showing an inside look to the beginning of an epidemic that is still plaguing humans today. The film follows Ned Weeks (Mark Ruffalo) a writer who comes head first with the AIDS epidemic in the early 1980's. He helps start a gay support group with his best friend Bruce Niles (Taylor Kitsch) and a few other ""friends"". The film takes place over the span of three years as this group gets bigger while basically nothing is done to curb the spread of the deadly disease.<br/><br/>This film tackles an important topic from the point of view of people on the front lines. Julia Roberts plays the only doctor in NYC working to try to figure out a cure. The film doesn't call it AIDS until nearly the last 20 minutes of the film. It's spoken about as gay cancer. Because in the beginning only gay men seem to be dying from it. This film is directed by Ryan Murphy (American Horror Story, Glee) based on a play by Larry Kramer.<br/><br/>This film is all about the performances. You get the 80's feel with the soundtrack and the direction. But this film wouldn't hit home if it weren't for the standout performances. Mark Ruffalo when given the chance can kill a performance and here is outstanding. You feel for him and at times are frustrated with his character but he has a drive that can't be denied. I highly doubt that we won't see him holding Emmy and a Golden Globe later this year. Matt Bomer of White Collar plays Ruffalo's boyfriend and he's so compelling in his character. This man has acting chops.<br/><br/>Taylor Kitsch proves that he doesn't need to be put in big action tent pole films. This guy can act and is not just a pretty face. I don't want to see this guy in any more summer action movies. Put him in dramas with meaty roles he can handle it. Jim Parsons of The Big Bang Theory shows up in a supporting role that is left field from his popular TV character and great for this film. I believe he is reprising his role from the stage production. He's not a comedian, but another actor that can pull of the dramatic role. And Julia Roberts is on in this. She isn't one of her normal characters and her scenes with Ruffalo are gold.<br/><br/>I would add this along with Prayers For Bobby as two films that not only the gay male community but humanity need to see. They are hard at times, but if just one person's idea is changed about the topic then the film has done it's job. Because that one person could influence many. The Normal Heart is a drama that hits home (for me being apart of the LGBTQ community) and is full of great performances. I hope that later in the year I'm seeing this film walk away with many awards because it deserves it. This is best thing Ryan Murphy has put his name to. (I'm not a fan of Glee)</div>]",1684226

That is how this was advertised but what audiences got was a sappy sluggish romance drama. The shining light within this drama is the stellar performances by both Julia Roberts and Jim Parsons.

This is very hypocritical, in our society where I am from is still a Gay relationships are unaccounted.

Unfortunately, this makes people more unaware that having unsafe sex can course for a illness or viral disease. When people weren't accepted by the society, they are willing to satisfy their sexual requirements hidden where very unsafe. This course more dangerous than accepting Gays are normal. 
If all the Gays can live a normal life, they will find a permanent life partner who will not sleep around.

It covered the identical time period and subject matter as the 2014 entry, and did it equally as well. In fact, recollections from the earlier movie kept ringing in my head, making the more recent one seem more like a remake.<br/><br/>I suppose that's the challenge of a production attempting to cover material previously done. After twenty years you'd think it long enough for one to forget the former. In this case, not so, which makes ""And the Band Played On"" even more powerful than it seemed on first viewing.<br/><br/>Both films are worthy entries on this unique period in US history.

23756473,26 August 2014,"[<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">Though firmly set at what was the beginning of the AIDS epidemic in 1980s New York, Kramers powerful play, now finally transformed to the screen is now more poignant and relevant than ever. Set among the lives of a group of fictional gay New Yorkers the group suddenly finds themselves unwillingly at the center of a medical enemy they cannot see or understand that divides their community and culture on how best to combat it. Meanwhile as the straight community acts with indifference, all around them friends and loved ones die and more begin to get sick.<br/><br/>Kramers main protagonist Ned Weeks (Ruffalo at his finest ever)loosely based on Kramer himself is the voice of sanity in the newly formed Gay Men's Health Crisis, while its first president Bruce Niles (Taylor Kitsch based on real activist Paul Popham) is more concerned about sending out invitations to a fund raiser with the word 'Gay' on them than he is with forcing the inactive major Ed Koch to attend a meeting with their group. Weeks begins to realize that not only does he have to take on the Government but his own community as well in order to galvanise them into action all the while their friends continue to die and his own lover even gets sick. Sympathetic to their cause is Doctor Brookner (Julia Roberts) who herself comes up against a wall of inaction in her own health authority. <br/><br/>I can only pray that more heterosexuals and those who think this may never effect them actually watch this piece of work for it is truly an outstanding piece of writing and also a masterclass in acting. Kramer cleverly underlines the dangers of inaction and bureaucracy when facing such an epidemic as well as tackling fearlessly the difficulties the Gay community faced not only from outside but from within. He cleverly does this by writing Weeks his main protagonist as unsympathetically as possible, yet this isn't a film where you don't connect with the main character, your with him all the way. So many scenes will touch and frustrate you and Kramer cleverly tackles wider issues in small segments of dialogue, giving so many different people a voice in this piece. (How some Lesbians became involved in the struggle is well covered in one scene, the naivety of a cheating politician in another..)This is a man who understands how to cleverly deliver a point without resorting to pathos. <br/><br/>Plaudits too all round for the supporting cast - Especially outstanding is Matt Bomer who plays Felix, Jim Parsons proves he capable of handling the right dramatic role and even a couple of people from And The Band Played On (B.D Wong &amp; Stephen Spinella) turn up in minor roles.<br/><br/>If Kramer had been less willing to point fingers at all those who played their part this piece would have been all the weaker. It seems a shame that this has taken so long to come to the screen, but I am glad I finally got to see it, hard though it was to remind me of all my friends, men and women, gay and straight who have passed on before their time. But equally it was a reminder that there were those who stood up and did something when others did nothing. <br/><br/>The experience of the epidemic up close and personal is not an easy one for many to digest but it would pay to remember that this is still what the epidemic is like now for all those people who cannot afford the medication available. This is one film that should be seen by everyone, it is the responsible thing to do, it is the right thing to do.

As Ned Weeks (who's actually a fictitious Larry Kramer - written by Larry Kramer) Ruffalo finally proves himself an actor who manages to get under your skin. While this movie reminded me of the miniseries Angels in America and the documentary Sex Positive, it certainly comes out as one of the best films concerning gay topics in a long time (apart from Pride, which is probably one of my favorite pictures about homosexuals ever). With incredibly strong speeches from Ruffalo, but also Taylor Kitsch, Joe Mantello (goosebumps!), Julia Roberts and Jim Parsons, this is a very actor-driven feature. Probably because it originally is a theater play. Although The Normal Heart sometimes is a bit too sentimental, it never bothered me due to the fantastic writing and dialogue. In a time that was emotionally devastating, everyone tried to cope with the new situation in their own way. Some people are more sanguineous than others and that makes social relations hard, even impossible in some cases.

15977902,5 September 2014,"[<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">'THE NORMAL HEART': Four Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>Made for HBO TV movie about a gay writer (and activist) attempting to inform the world about the HIV-AIDS epidemic, during it's onset in the early 1980s. It was directed by Ryan Murphy (who's famous for writing and directing many popular TV shows, like 'GLEE', 'AMERICAN HORROR STORY' and 'NIP/TUCK') and written by Larry Kramer. Kramer also wrote the successful 1985 play (of the same name) it's based on. The film stars Mark Ruffalo, Taylor Kitsch, Matt Bomer, Jim Parsons, Joe Mantello, Jonathan Groff (of 'GLEE' fame), Alfred Molina and Julia Roberts. I found it to be extremely informative and also, at times, really emotional. <br/><br/>The film is set in New York City, from 1981 to 1984. During this time the HIV-AIDS disease was becoming a crisis, especially among gay people. Ned Weeks (Ruffalo) was an openly gay writer and activist who founded the 'Gay Men's Health Crisis' advocacy group and made it his mission to try to inform everyone he could about the deadly virus. Due to his public aggressiveness he had many conflicts with his own organization, especially it's elected president (Kitsch). He did find a lot of support from his lover (Bomer) and a doctor (Roberts), fighting to stop the plague as well.<br/><br/>This is a section of history I knew little about, so this movie was very interesting and compelling to me. Any compassionate person should be able to sympathize with the gay community, especially at this time, because (like this movie shows) it did seem like they were abandoned by society and left to die off; from a brutal disease that most people (unaffected by it) weren't willing to learn about. It is a very moving story and the cast here does a great job bringing it to life. The directing is good as well and Kramer's writing is brilliant. Definitely a great history lesson; at least for those who aren't as informed on the subject (like me).<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/Ew1sXPb- oQQ</div>]",1684226
3967726,2 January 2015,"[<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">The last film I watch in 2014 is Ryan Murphy's much hyped HBO TV movie, a sob-fest chronicles the life of a gay activist Ned Weeks (Ruffalo) during the inception of HIV epidemic in the 80s. <br/><br/>Kick-starting in a flamboyant beach shindig in Fire Island to celebrate Ned's ex-boyfriend Craig (Groff)'s B-day, the film cunningly put Ned's wallflower awkwardness in the foreground among all the alluring parade of the gay sub-culture, right after the sexual revolution. But the gleeful hedonism doesn't stick, Craig's faint spell suggests a new kind of hazard will prey on the minority group and as we know it - it has haunting the world ever since. <br/><br/>Ned, as a screen proxy of the writer Larry Kramer, is an out-and-out advocate of complete coming-out and an adamant fighter, all for a well-intended cause, but his attitude of absolutisation reveals the biggest flaw in his personality, which puts him in sheer contrast with Bruce Niles (Kitsch), Craig's boyfriend and the president of GMHC (Gay Men's Health Crisis) organization, a gorgeous blond hasn't outed yet. Murphy and Kramer launches a friend-or-foe tug-of-war between Ned and Bruce, keeps the undercurrent running tepidly without choosing sides. Ned's radical remarks on TV and his uncompromising modus operandi is thrilling for showboating, but it is a far cry from a mature political strategy to get things on their right tracks; meanwhile, the film doesn't give enough lucid information of the decisions made from Bruce's side since the whole story is narrated from Ned's POV, which makes the plot twist of Ned's dismissal a bit arbitrary although one cannot argue he should have seen it coming. <br/><br/>Prominently, the film is inundated with poignant speeches and melodramatic moments, each of the main cast dominates their spotlight in staunch virtuosity, starting from supporting actors, Bomer as Felix Turner, a Times journalist and Ned's boyfriend, a too- good-to-be-true prince charming for Kramer in real life (he takes the initiative while Ned is clearly oblivious of him after a hookup in the darkness, oh gosh, how can anyone forget someone as yummy as Bomer, even in the pitch black, it is pure baloney!), is utterly heartbreaking to watch in his startling physical transformation as a HIV patient in his last days, likened to Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto in DALLAS BUYERS CLUB (2013, 7/10), the weight-loss trick works again, moreover, Bomer hits the perfect note when facing Ruffalo in their intimate time, up to their final wedding scenes, it can easily strikes one's soft spot. <br/><br/>Joe Mantello, a famous Broadway director, plays Micky Marcus, Ned's friend and college in GMHC, not a familiar face in front of the camera, but he totally nails his imploding monologue with multiple layers of emotions, a bona-fide showstopper with sharp empathy and arouse heartfelt admiration. Jim Parsons, is another surprise, conveys his role Tommy Boatwright, the executive director of GMHC, with subdued nuances, his eulogy to a deceased friend is another highlight in the movie, really he has liberated himself from the persistent screen-image as Sheldon Cooper (he is also the only cast member from the original play to reprise his role). Also worth mentioning is Alfred Molina, plays Ben, Ned's loving brother, brings a different standpoint from a straight man, not the usual apathy or aversion, instead he is quite open to Ned's sexuality and supports him unconditionally, but one barrier is always there to keep him from accepting him as an equal, which points out as an astute reality check. <br/><br/>Julia Roberts, deglamorises herself as the wheelchair-bound doctor Emma Brookner, who represents the righteous core of the line of work, fights against the bureaucratic inhumanity and social bias, Roberts gives a galvanising performance especially in her showdown time with the evil side of her peer. Also connects her polio situation with the rampant AIDS aggression - it is just a virus and no one has polio now. Finally, our hero Ned, Mark Ruffalo acts against his usual amiability, and imbues a whiff of waywardness attached to a very assertive approach, often he is upstaged by his more plot-driven co-stars, nevertheless, it is undeniable that he superlatively makes Ned a real human out of the exhausting bereavement overload.<br/><br/>Frankly speaking, the film feels too much reckoning on the fine-tuned character study from its sterling thespians, while the focal point of gay politics is basically being overshadowed or over-simplified, as it is always easier to re-enact past stories since viewers have already grasped the gist beforehand, the film serves only to cherry-pick certain affecting episodes to impress and preach. But still this is an urgent issue needs to be disseminated and reach as many people as possible, to edify and impress, to extol unbiased love, on these grounds, one must give Murphy and his team a big thumb up.</div>]",1684226
2898520,25 September 2014,"[<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">It's 1981 and gay men are enjoying their sexual freedom. Only more and more of them are dying. Nobody knows what the cause is. Ned Weeks (Mark Ruffalo) is a writer. Ben (Alfred Molina) is his brother. Dr. Emma Brookner (Julia Roberts) is advocating for gay men to stop having sex. Felix Turner (Matt Bomer) is the NY Times writer who usually does fluff pieces. Bruce Niles (Taylor Kitsch) and Tommy Boatwright (Jim Parsons) are some of the people in the gay community.<br/><br/>The first 30 minutes is more thrilling and more compelling than any overblown action. The scenes of people trying to figure out what to do are the best. It's exciting. It's also scary like a horror movie. The romance between Weeks and Turner is the weakest part of the movie. There is a big epidemic and the love story diminishes it. For some reason, I'm reminded of Michael Bay's Pearl Habor. The world is changing and I rather have the movie concentrate on the war, not the romance. I get more from Ned and his brother. I understand where they're going with the romance but it feels more like a waste of time. There are so many great scenes with great acting. Joe Mantello explodes on the screen.

Also I get they have to show sex and that gay men as a whole are promiscuous but the graphic nature of some of the sex scenes is so off-putting that again.. makes you unsympathetic to the fact they were all catching AIDS.

1581184,19 October 2014,"[<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">I found Ryan Murphy's production rather difficult to watch. The action unfolds in a series of circular movements, with the newly- formed GMHC (Gay Men's Health Clinic) trying to obtain funds from central or local government to combat the rapidly-spreading AIDS crisis, yet being continually frustrated in their efforts. Spearheaded by activist Ned Weeks (Mark Ruffalo), the group try every possible means to advance their cause, including television appearances, leaflet distribution, and installing a telephone hot-line. <br/><br/>As they continue their work, so many of their closest friends become infected with the disease and pass away. Sometimes the pain of loss is quite unbearable: when Ned loses his boyfriend Felix Turner (Matt Bomer) in a hospital ward, he embraces Felix in a passionate embrace, while committed doctor Dr. Emma Brookner (Julia Roberts) affirms their wedding vows. In the background, we see Ned's lawyer brother Ben (Alfred Molina) vainly trying not to burst into tears.<br/><br/>The activists' campaign to obtain recognition becomes increasingly fractious as the film unfolds: many of the members resent Ned's increasingly strident public persona, and eventually they decide to cast him out. Such a decision is not universally acknowledged: Tommy Boatwright (Jim Parsons) tearfully embraces Ned in a gesture of enduring friendship.<br/><br/>What THE NORMAL HEART shows is the way in which the public campaign affects all the activists' live: it sows divisions among them where none existed before; it causes resentment as well as disillusion; and nothing ever seems to get done. In one telling scene Ned meets a White House staffer, whose sole aim seems to be to find out whether AIDS affects the heterosexual as well as the homosexual community. If not, then the staffer can feel relieved that his extra-marital affair with a whore will not be brought into public view.<br/><br/>The tone of Murphy's production becomes more intense as the action unfolds. There are at least two dramatic set-pieces, where first Ned and then his colleague Mickey Marcus (Joe Mantello) allow their emotions to get the better of them and start ranting against the government, their friends, and their basic helplessness in trying to continue their campaign. Their friends can do little else but try to console them. Both sequences might seem slightly hysterical in tone, but we have to bear in mind the emotional and physical strain experienced by all the protagonists. This is the only way they have to let off steam.<br/><br/>THE NORMAL HEART is an angry movie; based on a Broadway hit first performed over thirty years ago, it suggest that comparatively little has been done to combat the AIDS virus since it was brought to public attention. A series of sonorous title-cards at the end remind us of just how many victims there have been worldwide of the disease. Perhaps we need to have more dedicated doctors like Emma Brookner to continue research into the disease - if governments will permit them to do so. In a world dedicated to capitalism and money- making, this seems increasingly unlikely.</div>]",1684226

22490656,25 February 2011,"[<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">What a powerful and emerging film that depicts the two opposing sides of this universe. I was really surprised by the quality of this ""little"" film. This isn't a movie about two people talking in a room about random stuff. This isn't a film about two life-travelers that engage in an ongoing argument about the human condition. This is a film about the quality of life. Not the meaning of it but the quality. The details in it's design. The true valor's clockwork.<br/><br/>The duality of belief, as a general term, is analyzed completely in this great approach of the Cormac McCarthy novel in which the two main protagonists, ""named"" simply Black (Samuel L. Jackson) and White (Tommy Lee Jones) are debating over a serious and dangerous issue. ""White tried to jump in front of a train and Black came and saved his ass. He carries him in his apartment and tries to put some sense into this White dude."" Right? Not really. ""The movie also promotes religion and is an ongoing boredom that I completely despise."" RIght? Not really again. This has a greater meaning than just that. We live in a world filled with pathetic lies, corny truths, raised flags over white buildings and big letters over or on the dark ones. We live in a world where prostitution is legalized even in the cultural state of the society. We live in a world where rejection, where pain, where slavery and failure are common attraction to the atrocious tourists. We are hoping to free the world from the hands of the manipulators and selfish dictators, we organize revolutions, we fight for freedom but in the end we all get trapped in the same positions as we were before. This is what this movie is about. It's about the ongoing fight carried to win our faith back. Faith, science, culture, logic, mathematics, metaphors, feelings, achievements... They are all the same. They are contents, ingredients and thoughts that the humankind must have in order to survive the greatest threat of them all. The threat which is not the monetary system, the threat which is not the harsh reality, the threat which is not the solely figurative place of the man in the world, but the threat that is represented in the lack of faith in ourselves. We are our own guides because we rule this world. This is why this movie has captured my attention completely. It's not a masterpiece, it's not a grand scale picture, it's not a studio banking option, it's not even part of the best films in the last years but... at the same time... it's simply great. I loved it because it really balances amazingly well the truth revealed along the film with the denouement. They are identical as both form and content.<br/><br/>I also liked the little details like the black coffee, the text erased at the bottom of the Bible, the absence of TV and radio, the lockers on the door and not to mention the biggest detail of them all... the room. Just think about the room vs. everything else. Order vs. Chaos. Even in a messy world we could find order...<br/><br/>Going further to the execution, the story is well structured, the dialogues are haunting, the clichés are gone because even if you find them they tend to leap by the end of the film, the acting is impeccable and the technical aspect of the movie was a comfortable surprise. It's exactly what the film needed. I can't talk too much about this film because I don't want to enter into the details... I just hope people could see what a good movie this really is.

If (as he says) the hope of human civilization was extinguished in the gas chambers of Dachau, then it was resurrected in the revolt of Treblinka. If the horrors of the human slave trade and the Middle Passage obliterates the nobility of our species, then Harriet Tubman reorients us to the possibility of ourselves and shows us the true face of prophecy.<br/><br/>Joseph Asagai answers White's pessimism in _A Raisin in the Sun_ by dismissing the notion that he and others like him are ""realists"".

Jackson) who stops a white atheist (Tommy Lee Jones) from killing himself. Later that day the two men find themselves inside the black man's ghetto apartment where they share stories about their past as well as their different views on religion, life and death. This film is based on the Cormac McCarthy play of the same name but I had no idea what the film was about. I basically went into this thing based on the reputations of Jackson and Jones and the end results was a movie that makes you think and that's pretty rare these days. The film runs just under 90-minutes and we only have two different characters who are trying to figure out the other. The only thing that brought these men together was Jones' attempted suicide and Jackson being there to save him. I must admit that the film was extremely deep and it's probably going to be hard for most to gather everything with just one viewing but the opinions brought up from both characters will probably stay with most for a very long time. The screenplay by McCarthy does a terrific job at bouncing back and forth between various subjects. Throughout the dialogue we learn about both men and we get various bits and pieces as the film moves along. We learn that Jackson was in prison where he nearly beat a man into becoming a deformed cripple but this wasn't the worst thing he has done in his life. We learn that Jones hated his parents and doesn't have a single friend. The film takes basic set-ups like these and takes them into so many directions that you can't help but hang onto every word that's spoken and can't wait to see where it leads. The discussion of religion is one of the most frank conversations I've ever heard. Jackson's very passionate about God and his reasons make sense. Jones, on the other hand, is very passionate that there isn't anything out there and his reasons also make sense. The film doesn't try to say which person is right or why the other is wrong. Instead we're given two characters with different opinions and that's what makes the story work so well. Both Jackson and Jones do splendid work and there's no question that both give some of the best performances we're going to see in 2011. Jackson has the louder role and there's no one better when it comes to giving passionate line reading. Jones has mostly a quiet part but he says so much with that wonderful face of his that you can feel his pain even when he isn't saying anything. Both men do a terrific job together and what I enjoyed most is how their acting towards one another changed as the film moved along and as their characters became more familiar and comfortable with the other. The film asks a lot of questions and if you're looking for answers then you might be disappointed. The movie makes the right choice of not trying to answer everything but instead it just throws ideas out there and forces the viewer to make up their own mind. This is a complicated little movie but it's a real gem and Jones does a very good job bringing it to life.</div>]",1510938

32817815,13 February 2013,"[<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">I watched The Sunset Limited alone at home on a DVD loaned to me by a friend. I didn't read any reviews before watching it and so I had absolutely no idea what to expect. That was a good thing because, if I had read some of the negative reviews on IMDb, I may have even skipped watching it. That would have been a bad thing.<br/><br/>This film is amazing! With a cast of two and only one scene (if you discount the opening generic footage), to me this seemed obviously a play written for live theatre. However, in live theatre, you don't get the chance to view facial expressions close-up or rewind and study details the same as you do in a movie at home. And that was certainly something I wanted to do. Every moment of this film is significant and one cursory glimpse simply doesn't do it justice. <br/><br/>Tommy Lee Jones and Samuel L Jackson perform their roles with classic professional expertise. You feel like a fly on the wall almost to the point where you even want to breathe quietly so as not to disturb the atmosphere. That is the profundity of The Sunset Limited! The ending wasn't at all predictable - if, indeed it WAS the ending - were we supposed to make our own ending like in one of those early computer text story games?<br/><br/>After watching the titles, I was left with two questions. One was, ""How on earth did it need THAT many people to make this film???"" Tommy Lee Jones directed it and yet there was only the closing scene that he wasn't in. If it weren't for the brilliance of two totally professional actors, this film could have been the work of my university screen production class (I wish it HAD been!). For example, how did it require five painters to prepare the set? These are, of course, somewhat rhetorical questions although, as I say, I'm pretty sure my uni class could have done this as an assignment with just two cameras and camerapersons, one lighting engineer, one sound engineer, a boom swinger, an editor and a sound designer. We would have done all the other stuff such as preparing the set ourselves. In fact, we DID do that except that the director, camera operators and lighting people were also the editors! Now, I don't say this to denigrate this film at all because, as I've already said, it is an excellent movie. All I'm saying is that, given talents like Jackson and Jones, we could have made this movie for not much more than the cost of tape and, if we had done it professionally, six people's time (about a month). So, when I see the crew list for The Sunset Limited, I cannot help wondering what it cost to make. (IMDb doesn't tell us that.)<br/><br/>My second question was, ""How many times will I need to watch this movie before I get every little nuance of it?""<br/><br/>Having now read some of the other reviews, it is obvious to me that there are plenty of viewers out there with IQs well below average because some of them not only clearly missed the philosophical and psychological message of this masterpiece, but also lacked the ability to write something remotely intellectual about it - and an intellectual film it is.

It was ""A breach in the very unity of life, a biological paradox, an abomination, an absurdity, an exaggeration of disastrous nature. Life had overshot its target, blowing itself apart.""<br/><br/>That life has not the meaning — the teleological sense that humans desperately crave — has been known from the times of the ancient Greeks, and echoed by clever artists through the centuries to our present day. The problem of existential nihilism had never any resemblance to other animal problems; this is because it is not a disease that is seen as having its origin in anything other than being human. And if a cure to human angst, to our the essence — the absurdity of the overdeveloped animal — can only be in death, it does not mean that there are no palliatives that can mask the problem.<br/><br/>So, what will happen if anchoring oneself to a ""foundational firmament"" does not work anymore? ""Depressions, excesses, and suicides result."" But is going back a viable option? that is what the movie tries to answer. We cannot but anchor ourselves to something, be it a religion, or a cause, or the aspects of our own culture; for unleashing yourself from them will only lead to a horrific fall into the soul crushing abysm of being an intelligent animal in a not so intelligent world.</div>]",1510938

The sometimes halting, awkward way that Temple speaks combined with the often too-loud volume must have been difficult for her to mimic. But Danes managed to do it very convincingly. The director, Mick Jackson, should also be proud of what he's accomplished. The addition of the moving cattle diagrams and the distorted sounds really gave the viewer an idea of how Temple's mind works.

It spans from the mid 1950s to the late 1970s.<br/><br/>Claire Danes is Temple Grandin, born with autism at a time when autism was not yet understood. An indication was telling the mother that the 4-year-old girl should be institutionalized, ostensibly for the rest of her life, because there was no ""cure."" This movie, and Temple Grandin's life, shows that there is no cure, but it also shows how that cannot hold back a person with the correct motivation.<br/><br/>I've always liked Claire Danes, as a pleasant actress in lightweight roles, but her performance here caught me completely off guard.

I have seen many, many great performances in my 50+ years of enjoying movies and none were better than hers here.<br/><br/>Julia Ormond is her mother Eustacia and Catherine O'Hara is her Aunt Ann, where Temple first was exposed to life on a farm while visiting her for the summer before college.<br/><br/>Temple had difficulty but managed high school, and then also college. She was unusually bright, but not in the usual sense. She could not just listen to a subject, she had to visualize it, experience it, and when she did was able to master it like few could. In college her great motivator was David Strathairn as Dr. Carlock, a science teacher. Not only did he stand up for her when others wanted to dismiss her as too difficult, he taught her that when she sees a door (a barrier) she should look it as a door of opportunity. She kept that vision as she encountered barriers, and she encountered them often.<br/><br/>Temple Grandin was both practical and empathetic. One of her specialties became livestock, cattle. She knew they had a purpose, to be killed for our food, but she set out to improve the handling of cattle so as to keep them calm and minimize their suffering. It is estimated that 50% of the cattle handled in North America today are done so by techniques she pioneered and worked to have implemented.

Nothing could be further from the truth. The film deals with autism in an honest, extremely sympathetic and intelligent way. While there have been other films that deal with the various forms of autistic behavior ('Adam', 'Rainman', 'What's Eating Gilbert Grape', I am Sam', 'The Other Sister', 'Forest Gump', 'Little Man Tate' to name a few of the better known ones), few succeed on the level of this beautifully written adaptation of autobiographical books by the title character Dr. Temple Grandin (adapted by Christopher Monger and Merritt Johnson). It is fearless in its discussion of autism and for once shows how the autistic mind can function (for Temple, it functions in pictures and leads to a highly successful career as a scientist) in a manner that can be an incredible resource for mankind. It simply works on every level, much to the sensitivity of director Mick Jackson who seems to understand the complexities of the mind of the central character as well as the responses of all of the ancillary characters. <br/><br/>Claire Danes BECOMES Temple Grandin, so fine is her acting and her ability to bring the audience (and the cast of characters) into the inner workings of the autistic mind. It is an astonishing performance of a mute four year old girl encouraged by her mother (Julia Ormond), her aunt (Catherine O'Hara), and one particular science teacher Professor Carlock (David Strathairn) who teaches her that doors (a common thread throughout the film) are meant to be opened because opportunity lies beyond. How Temple progresses from special schools, learns to build a hugging machine that supplies the lack of embraces she apparently missed as a child, and becomes obsessed with the inhumane treatment of cattle in her observations of ranches and slaughter houses in Arizona, leads her to earning not only a college degree, but also a Masters and a PhD in Animal Husbandry. Throughout the movie Claire Danes maintains her character's idiosyncrasies and her reaction to the frightening world around her with such credibility that she takes us with her on a journey of understanding the miracles that can happen with the minds of autistic people: no one thinks outside the box in a more positive manner than does Temple Grandin.

Supporting actors/ actresses include: Julia Ormond plays Temple's mother Eustacia; David Strathairn plays Dr. Carlock, a teacher at a school; and Catherine O'Hara plays Temple's Aunt Ann. Temple struggled with her autism quite a bit as a child. As she became a young adult she learns how to cope with it and use it to improve her life as well as making major contributions to the cattle industry. Temple's autism makes relating to people difficult, which is where the movie begins. Eustacia wants only the best for Temple, but she can no longer deal with Temple's issues. Dr. Carlock enables Temple to uncover her extraordinary talents and provides her with the ability to recognize opportunities and how to take advantage of them. This movie exhibits more of the abilities of people with autism, much like The Other Sister and I am Sam. The movie also demonstrates the power of close-up shots to show the emotion in Temple's face when dealing with difficult situations. Watching her contort her face made me, unconsciously, do the same, as if I were experiencing her stress level. I found the transitions a little disturbing only because they do not fit the story. It does not follow a natural time line, going from present to past and then back to the present. It may have been better done in documentary style, from beginning to end. The use of special effects seems to be an effort to try to give the viewer the feeling of what an autistic person may experience.

The years covered by this production, mostly the sixties and early seventies, when autistic people and the role of women were so poorly understood-- and it is an important element in the film that the main character meets rejection because of problems not only with social acceptability but also with those of gender-- in mainstream America, were the golden age for many engaged and dramatically engaging film hits. This kind of cinematic and emotionally-satisfying fare pleased the general public and filled the coffers of the movie studios that now reject practically every intelligent project that comes their way, and actresses like Claire Danes and so many others have to wait years before being offered something that truly suits their talent, and then it is often for the ""small"" screen. It is no surprise, then, that every contributor to this film seems to recognize the importance of what they are involved with, totally aware of their part in this beautiful tapestry of character acting, intelligent direction, sensitive teleplay writing, graphic design, photography, editing, and sound effects (with reserves for the music which often sounded like a Philip Glass piece being used in a scientific documentary film). This harmonization and the emotional satisfaction it brings about when we are experiencing-- almost living-- the film bring back memories of those sixties and seventies film masterpieces like ""The Last Picture Show,"" ""Nashville,"" ""Five Easy Pieces"" or ""Raging Bull"" whose technical and emotional unity created fans of American cinema all over the world and were appreciated by audiences who paid little attention to their ""PG"" or ""R"" ratings and turned out in large numbers (of course this feeling that even the seamstresses who stitched the costumes were committed to the message and meaning of the film they were working on is often perceptible in great films from all periods-- be it ""Carnival in Flanders"" or ""Ed Wood""). In the US, what is left of these audiences now have to turn to cable TV or Sundance Festival ""Independent"" films. In Europe, Hollywood's serious reputation continues to decline as audiences stop expecting American films to be worthwhile. I sincerely hope this film will be viewed in movie theaters as a shared experience among its viewers there: it deserves a theatrical release and will serve as a reminder that American cinema can still be rewarding.

650255,13 March 2010,"[<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">The first thing that must be said in commenting on this movie is that Claire Danes is absolutely superb as Temple Grandin - this is truly one of the best performances I've seen in any production in years. I've known people with autism/asperger's, and she captured the condition perfectly - from her fear of human contact, to her inability to interact ""normally"" (whatever that is) in social situations, to her brilliance - because many with this condition truly are brilliant people who (as the movie points out) just happen to perceive the world and think about the world in different ways than most of us. Danes was unbelievable.<br/><br/>The story of Temple Grandin's life is also a great story of overcoming the odds. Again, as the movie properly notes, in the 50's people with this condition would be institutionalized. She, on the other hand, was kept at home and nurtured and educated and challenged to become all that she was capable of. In that respect, in some ways this movie is really a tribute to her mother. Eventually, Temple did succeed beyond what most people (with or without autism) are able to do - ending up with a PhD in Animal Science and becoming a leading advocate of the humane slaughter of animals in the food industry and a designer of humane slaughter houses. Because of that, my biggest concern is that the real point of the movie (which is to educate the viewer about the condition and about the potential possessed by people with the condition) is going to be lost, and this will end up becoming a part of the animal rights debate - which I understand has already happened, as some animal rights advocates have criticized Temple, while others (most notably PETA) have praised her. The point is - that's not the point of the movie! This isn't about animal rights, and - while it's a biographical movie - it isn't even really about Temple Grandin.

Not because she's a breathtaking beauty. Or even necessarily because her story is full of blockbuster plot twists.<br/><br/>It's her brain. The HBO original film ""Temple Grandin,"" directed by Mick Jackson and starring Claire Danes in the title role, does a brilliant and beautiful job of illustrating how her unique brain thinks in pictures. Instant recall of every image you've ever seen is both a blessing and a curse and the movie shows how she learns, with the help of her mother, aunt and teachers, to use her assets, even as she struggles with the limitations that autism imposes on her.<br/><br/>Diagnosed as autistic at the age of four, Temple Grandin was encouraged and sometimes pushed by her devoted mother, depicted here by Julia Ormond, to engage with the world, take a look at it from her distinct point of view and make it a better place. Though doctors predicted she would never speak, she ultimately graduated both high school and college and became a world-renowned animal behaviorist, completely revolutionizing the treatment of livestock in the cattle industry.<br/><br/>She also became one of the most respected advocates for autistic people, giving interviews and doing speaking engagements, writing books and teaching college classes. Not bad for someone who was never supposed to speak, huh? (I'm not really giving away the plot by telling you this, because the film is not about what she does, so much as the way she does it.) As I watched this movie, I wondered, ""Why couldn't this film have come out before 'Rainman?'"" Then, at least, parents of autistic children -- and the world at large -- would have more than one popular image of what autism can be.<br/><br/>Claire Danes is amazing; she just disappears into the role of Grandin. Granted, prosthetic teeth are used to subtly change the shape of her face, but she also captures what Grandin has described as her ""easily spooked"" quality in the skittish way she moves throughout the film. Ormond gives a moving performance as the mother who never flinches in the face of her daughter's disorder, pushing her constantly to expand her comfort zone. David Strathairn, one of my favorite actors, portrays her immensely supportive science teacher, Dr. Carlock, with quiet genius.<br/><br/>The real star of the film, though, is the director, who took what some might have turned into a mundane Lifetime movie-of-the-week and drew a startling and unforgettable portrait of a beautiful mind.<br/><br/>As the parent of an autistic child, I was mildly disappointed to find a couple of things missing in the film. Most of her childhood is absent, as filmmakers chose to focus on how she used her autism, as an adult, to reshape an entire industry. There is a scene that shows her mother relentlessly drilling a four-year-old Grandin on flashcards, but no scene that actually depicts her first words.<br/><br/>Also, Grandin has, in interviews, been very straightforward about the fact that she takes certain medication, including anti-depressants. She began taking these drugs in her 30s and gives them a lot of credit for her current functionality. This is missing from the film, which focuses on her more creative and natural means of calming herself in the face of stress.<br/><br/>The description of Temple that her mother instilled in her, that would later become her motto for autistic people everywhere -- ""different, but not less"" -- is a moving and simple message that I sincerely hope the world adopts as its view of autism. We may not always understand these special people, but as ""Temple Grandin"" so brilliantly illustrates, they have so much to offer the world and a unique way of looking at it.<br/><br/>(For a glimpse at our experience parenting an autistic child, check out the ""Spinning Plates"" blog at www.AmandaBroadfoot.com.)</div>]",1278469

I watched the film with her and she was amazed at how people would have even thought they needed to put Temple in a sanitarium. I loved how her mother managed to both recognize her daughter's condition (for lack of a better word) and also do her best to work with and around it. She made her daughter attend school, college etc and never allowed her to give up-even if that may have seemed like the easy way out.<br/><br/>Temple's connection with her blind friend made sense-the friend relying on sound and Temple relying on visuals made them a believable pair.<br/><br/>My daughter is at an age where people can be damn cruel. Instead of laughing at Temple's voice, mannerism etc-she asked why they were like that and after explaining what high functioning Autism is-she felt not sorry for Temple, but proud of her for her achievements. This is a truly inspirational film. Danes portrayal is amazing and I am hoping she gets a Golden Globe for it somewhere down the line.<br/><br/>I also was impressed with the visuals and the care taken in showing how information was being processed by Temple. Knowing that an Autistic person isn't so much staring in space, but seeing things in such a way it can be overwhelming makes one appreciate what they and their families contend with.<br/><br/>I read an article where someone asked Grandin if she could be ""cured"" of Autism, would she do it and her response was a resounding ""no""-to her, Autism is as much a part of her as the mind it affects and she is who she is because of it. Embracing her status and not making one feel ashamed for it just makes her accomplishments even more impressive and endearing.<br/><br/>For the reviewer who thought this was a watered down lifetime movie, so very wrong.

Finally, with herculean efforts primarily from his mother and father, he has developed considerable social skills. He will never be able to live totally independently. What shocked me as a 40 year veteran teacher in public schools, is how disingenuous the entire public school network was with him. They always promised so much more than they ever delivered. Every time behavior flared up suddenly, my grandson was nearly always suspended.<br/><br/>My heart went out to Temple Grandin. Clair Danes portrays her with a bug-eyed ferocity and a nearly hysterical panic. In an instant of Danes on screen, she simply became the character. Working in tandem with Danes is Julia Ormond who was also utterly convincing. David Straitharn portrays an ex-NASA scientist teaching in a special school who recognizes Temple's gift: She thinks like Albert Einstein, in images, and possesses a photographic memory.<br/><br/>With cases of autism rising alarmingly, I think that parents should view this docu-drama. The old educational practice of raising one bar for all students to jump over, needs to be replaced with cutting edge learning techniques. Our best students can learn by almost any means; no one can stop them from learning. If we are truly sincere in our intention of reaching every mind, then we need to do what works, and that goal requires a total re-orientation not only for special education students, but, moreover, for mainstreamed, home-schooled and all other students with any sort of special needs.

She didn't speak until after she was 4. Doctors recommended institutionalizing her. Fortunately, her mother (a Harvard graduate) refused to accept that advice. Due to some people who came into her life (an Aunt and Uncle who had a ranch; a science teacher at a boarding school) who were willing to allow her to develop in her own way, she not only overcame her fears and limitations but ended up her high school's valedictorian, went on to college, and made significant contributions to the cattle industry. She also has become a leading voice on dealing with autism.

A very pretty actress known more for playing sort of ""Damsel in distress"" roles,I couldn't immediately meld that image with that of the plain,can-do autistic woman by concept. But this movie set me right.<br/><br/>Even though this is literally a biopic,it still seems as much concerned with the nuts and bolts of her ideas and contributions to agriculture and the study of autism(most movies where autism is a topic only choose to deal with the character who is afflicted and how it affects the ones who are ""normal"",with precious little if anything offered about the person with the affliction)as it is about her. Besides Danes' bravura performance as Grandin(and I must say that physically,Miss Danes' eyes actually ARE perfect for the role. Just take a look at a photo of both women!),much credit goes to director Mick Jackson and the editing,which is able to give about as good a sampling of what Professor Grandin's thought processes are as can be done in a ""one-shot"" movie can give.<br/><br/>Not a real populous cast(i.e. much of the people involved are mostly ""non-entities"": people who have contact with Temple but have either negative or no direct impact on her life),but the support is largely patient and fit in well--David Straithairn as a kindly science teacher who sort of sets Miss Grandin on her way as a youth;Catherine O'Hara as the aunt living in Arizona who goes out of her way to accommodate the title character and Julia Ormond as Temple's strong-willed(if perhaps sometimes hard-headed),educated mother--and aid the movie along its stated path.<br/><br/>Perfect for HBO(I frankly have no real idea how this movie could EVER be sold as a large screen offering,and that's NOT a knock on this film at all!),it's running time moves like a breeze and,if you are in any way engaged by what you see in it,will want to see it more times and maybe even do some real digging about the main subject(who is currently in her mid-sixties,still a tenured professor at Colorado State University),either or both by internet research and her numerous writings.

The film also shows great performances by Julia Ormond (her mother), Catherine O'Hara (her understanding Aunt Ann), and David Straitharn as Doctor Carlock (who mentors her). Temple must overcome many obstacles to get to college and later graduate school. She'll never have a closeness or need to be touched like most of us do. She has to prove herself not only in schools where she's laughed at and ridiculed but also in the cattle fields and slaughterhouses where she's surrounded by male authorities who don't seem to care for her and she doesn't care for them as well. She loves animals and it shows. She relates to them and they to her. Her squeezing machine brought controversy when she was in college but she had to fight to keep it in her room. Thank God, she got an understanding roommate, a blind girl who understood her and became her friend. This movie is an inspiration to those with autism, Aspergers', or anything similar to that nature. Just because Temple was diagnosed autistic at 4 years old, the doctor recommended an institution but her mother wisely refused. Temple would emerge to be a great student, educator, and inspiration to us all especially in understanding animals and being humane to them.

19574789,4 December 2010,"[<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">As the parent of a child on the spectrum, I began watching ""Temple Grandin"" on the recommendation of friends and relatives, but guardedly, having seen the media present autistic individuals too many times as either hopelessly retarded or idiot savants. <br/><br/>What a thrill to be so wrong! This representation was so far from what we see by Hollywood or People Magazine that for me it was more than art: it was an act of love. Further, it stands about as close to true documentary as a scripted film can while still engrossing the viewer. This accuracy was possible due to a director with true passion for his subject - who read Grandin's books carefully, researched the places and people of her life, consulted closely with the animal scientist herself, and--most of all--chose the brilliant Claire Danes to represent her. There is no made-up romance (""that wouldn't have been characteristic,"" Grandin herself has commented wryly) and no fairytale ending of all social problems dissolved. This is the real deal.<br/><br/>Danes, with benefit of both body movement and speech dialect coaches, has nailed Dr. Grandin in every respect (if we can ignore the prettier features and better dental work). Without question, had this been a big-budget, nationally marketed film, an Oscar would have been in order. The avoidance of eye contact, awkward verbal expression,and intense anxiety in high-sensory situations will be familiar to anyone who is close to an autistic person - as will the single-mindedness, determination, and authenticity that the world could use more of.<br/><br/>The story itself is relied in varying points of time, sometimes out of sequence, and we are treated to images of the kind that Grandin herself experiences, constantly, as she sees the world around her in pictures,rather than words. We learn that this unique perspective aligns her with that of animals - and made her transformative designs for cattle chutes the ingenious devices they are.<br/><br/>The parents among us nod to see the lengths Mrs. Grandin will go to, to make sure Temple is not institutionalized, and to force her daughter to speak at age four; like both the mother and aunt, we can't help but choke up to see Temple daring to croak out ""When You Walk Through a Storm"" as a commencement speaker at college. We see her ability to help cattle get managed humanely as an extension of how we, after all, should treat other humans,whether or not they appear different from us. It is almost impossible in fact, NOT to be inspired by this woman, once thought retarded, who achieved not only a PhD in her field but status as a spokesperson for all autistic individuals.<br/><br/>How could this be done without being sentimental or saccharine? For one, Grandin is never presented as pathetic: she is tough,clear sighted and determined, even when others openly ridicule her or she faces paralyzing panic attacks. She is different, to be sure: funny, clumsy, socially inept, odd - but real, believable. Even Dr. Grandin, in her voice-over commentary has said ""it was uncanny - it was exactly like watching myself in high school, but from a distance.""<br/><br/>Are there any flaws? Well, a few: we learn absolutely nothing about Grandin's father. And, while Mrs. Grandin claims early on to a psychologist ""I have another one and have treated both children the same and she is the one who didn't respond to me,"" the mystery sibling is never introduced. True, one has to shorten and telescope a life for effect - but a few mentions could have helped fill in the blanks.<br/><br/>But--this is a small quibble. Watch the original film once; then listen to the commentary to get additional insight from director, Danes, and subject. There are heroes all around us. If you ever doubt, spend a good afternoon watching, learning, and thinking - whether in pictures like Grandin, or just through your own mental filters - you will be better off for it.</div>]",1278469

In spite of a condition that set her apart from others (and even prevented her from enjoying the normal intimacy and affection available from a loving mother), Temple Grandin taught herself not merely to function but to achieve. In part this seems to have been the result of her brilliance and spirit, and in part it was because of support from her mother, aunt, science teacher, and no doubt others.<br/><br/>I don't know much about autism, but I suspect that the story told in this film is not typical. First of all, it may well be that other autistic people have more severe symptoms than Temple Grandin. Second, we have only glimpses of the difficulties (and heartbreak) experienced by her mother; these must have been very great. Finally, I suspect that the mean treatment that Temple Grandin encountered from schoolmates in the film is mild in comparison to the torment that kids routinely inflict upon schoolmates who are in some way ""different.""<br/><br/>Still, Temple Grandin's own story is one that lifted my spirits and won my admiration.

This movie earned all the accolades metered out to its many accomplishments. Emmy winning producer Gerson Saines strove for 10 years to bring this difficult story to the screen &amp; deserves full credit.<br/><br/>Having been the third director offered the job - UK born Mike Jackson (AKF: ""Tuesdays With Morrie"" '99 &amp; ""Denial"" '16) proved to be the right man for the task. Jackson, along with fellow UK director of photography Ivan Strasburg capture all the difficult moments in Grandin's life - as she grapples with Autism in all its debilitating and equally grandiose forms. A tour de force performance by Clair Danes (Les Miserables '98) brings Temples' demanding character vividly to life - she is terrific. A surprise to me was Julia Ormond as Temples mother - hers is a well realized performance adding greatly to the final product. David Strathairn (Goodnight and Goodluck '05) in a pivotal role as a teacher of science - fits his character very well. In fact everyone seems ideally cast.

Born in a time where autism was grossly misunderstood and treatments shoddy, Grandin overcomes much adversity, both social and medical, to not only make it through the education system and graduate, but also help implement much more humane methods of slaughter for cattle in the US that draw on her means of comfort and self control.<br/><br/>Simply put, 'Grandin' may be among the best biopics I have ever seen, and certainly one of HBO's finest in a long line of TV movies. Right off the bat, Danes give a career best performance, completely vanishing into the title role, not only through some subtle prosthetics but also carefully adopting the mannerisms of real people with the disorder. Speaking as someone who has a history tied to the disorder and its effects, she was absolutely spot on. Yet, in spite of the character's very matter of fact ways, she still imbues Temple with both a strong drive and passion for her work, as well as a strange optimism. Supporting her are the rock solid likes of Julia Ormond as her hard working though understandably stressed mother, Catherine O'Hara as her sweet, and ultimately influential, aunt, and David Straitham as her high school science teacher, who recognises and helps Temple develop her talents.<br/><br/>Beyond them though, Mick Jackson imbues the film with plenty of stylish flourish, mainly in the surreal representation of Temple's super-literal thoughts, which lead to some of the film's biggest yet also sincerest laughs (like when someone talks to Temple about 'animal husbandry', and her mind pictures it literally). Plus, the mainly South Western setting also gives the film an often gold-ish, very warm hue, which plays off nicely against the sometimes sombre, even harsh, nature of the material, complimented by excellent sound work that greatly emphasise how Temple struggles to cope with even mundane everyday tasks like walking through automatic doors, which feel more like a guillotine to her.<br/><br/>Honestly, there isn't really much negative that I think of, especially given how tight this script is and how it can balance drama and sometimes oddball humour. There maybe one or two points that kinda slowed, but that was never an issue for me really as the film would always pick right back immediately, and for some, the 'literal thoughts' may come off a little too silly, but again, it's actually fairly accurate to how such a mind works so you can't accuse it of being off base.

28080436,12 September 2011,"[<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">The film Temple Grandin is the real-life story of Temple Grandin, who was portrayed by Claire Danes. When Temple was four (4) years old, she was diagnosed with Autism because she did not speak. Temple's mother, Eustacia (Julia Ormond), wanted only the best for her so she taught Temple to speak, sent her to mainstream schools, and eventually off to college. Temple had some difficulty with the other children at her schools, but she overcame those difficulties because of her spirit and her ability to see things in ways other people cannot see. After graduating from college, Temple went on to get her Masters of Science degree and became an advocate for treating animals in humane ways.<br/><br/>Temple Grandin is an uplifting story of a person overcoming disadvantages and making a life for herself when others did not want to give her a chance. Temple struggled several times to make people understand that while she was different, she still deserved to go to school with others and that she had good ideas. Temple's first major struggle was when she went to college and was told she could not keep her ""squeeze machine"" in her dorm room. Her ""squeeze machine"" helped Temple calm down and was, to her, the only way she could stay in school.<br/><br/>Temple could see things in ways that other people could not see. Temple was able to figure out that cows walk in circles to calm themselves down and that if you walk the cows in circles, you can lead them anywhere calmly, even to the slaughterhouse. Temple used this idea to design a way to get the cows to do what the ranchers wanted them to do, without having to poke and prod the cows. Temple's techniques also saved the lives of many cows, even though they were destined for the slaughterhouse. Temple thought that the cows should be treated humanely, even though they would be slaughtered eventually. This film is similar to the film Rain Man because they both deal with people with autism who have extraordinary ability. Both Temple and Raymond ended up teaching other people lessons they would not have ordinarily learned.<br/><br/>Temple Grandin uses the motif of architectural drawings in this film to show how Temple sees things in ways that others do not see. (Boggs &amp; Petrie, 2008) When Temple would look at something, the filmmaker would show the item, and then superimpose an architectural type drawing over top of the item Temple was looking at. Temple was a very visual learner and could make just about anything. When she arrived at her Aunt Ann's (Catherine O'Hara) ranch, Temple designed a pulley system to make the ranch gate open and close without having to get out of the car. The design of this system was shown with the architectural drawing before the finished gate pulley system was shown in action. There were many other scenes in the film that were shown in this way as well.<br/><br/>Another motif used in this film is the montage of doors. (Boggs &amp; Petrie, 2008) Doors symbolized new beginnings for Temple. Whenever Temple saw a new door, pictures of other doors she had seen would flash on the screen and she would think to herself that this is a new door she must go through. These doors were a way for Temple to grow and become the woman she would become.<br/><br/>I always enjoy watching coming of age type films. This film was expertly acted by Claire Danes and I only wish it had been a film that was widely released. This film is now available on DVD, but was originally only broadcast on HBO. I had never heard of this film before, and I am really glad that I decided to watch it.<br/><br/>Boggs, J. M. &amp; Petrie, D. W. (2008). The Art of Watching Films. (7th Ed.) New York, NY.

That's probably where we should leave it. But if you want to know the harsh reality (and the reason why I'm torn on whether to give this film a thumbs up or down), then read on...<br/><br/>This film glorifies Temple Grandin as an animal lover, animal rights activist and implied vegetarian (who is only shown eating jello and yogurt throughout the entire film) who was driven foremost by the desire to promote humane treatment of animals.

Most people would be nice and long-suffering but swear when out of her presence or with empathetic others. The film makers didn't introduce humour to lighten up the movie. This film didn't improve for me so I stopped watching it after an hour.</div>]",1278469
47811773,3 November 2013,"[<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">The film is a 2010 biography of Temple Grandin which was directed by Mick Jackson, and Claire Danes starred as Temple Gradin. This heartwarming story takes place in the 40's with a young mother trying to find a diagnosis for her child showing unusual behaviors.<br/><br/>Eustacia Grandin (Julie Ormon) had her daughter evaluated since she is four years old and hasn't spoken yet. The doctor told Eustacia her daughter has infantile schizophrenia and autism and may never speak. The doctor stated that autism is caused when the mother withholds physical affection during infancy. The doctor told Eustacia, he thought institutionalization would be an option for Temple. Autism and mental disorders were very misunderstood and had little research done during that time frame.<br/><br/>The theme of this thought provoking film is to be determined and never give up. This theme was underlying throughout the movie, if one door closes another door will open to let you accomplish your dreams and goals. Eustacia was determined to help her daughter and made a commitment to help her daughter speak and to flourish. Temple was misunderstood, since she had problems dealing with people and social settings. Temple would spend her summers at her Aunt Ann's (Catherine O'Hare) ranch and discovered she had a love for animals. She found a sense of peace when she was with her furry friends. She became fascinated with a cattle crush device on how it calms the cattle.<br/><br/>Temple was inspired by her mother and educators; one in particular was Dr. Carlock (David Strathain). Dr. Carlock was a science teacher and saw her abilities and the unique way Temple would learn. Dr. Carlock worked with Temple and discovered she would think in pictures. She could look at pages in a book and have the words memorized. Her unique and canny way to look at a situation and visualize on how to understand the information was astounding. When Temple was faced with difficult circumstances, she would visualize a door opening and remember Dr. Carlock's words: when you have a new door or challenge decide on how you are going to go through it.<br/><br/>This movie demonstrates the challenges and triumphs through her life while dealing with autism. The movie will motivate you to think outside of the box and be accepting of creatures regardless of their imperfections. Temple worked to overcome her limitations and to be a productive individual. Temple Grandin brings amazing insight on how to function in both worlds and taught others a lesson on how to be accepting of her disability.</div>]",1278469
481806,15 January 2012,"[<div class=""text show-more__control clickable"">""Who's this here Claire Danes?"" I muttered as I read the DVD box, playing the hayseed to vex the merger-weary corporate predators standing elbow to elbow about me. In fact, I had dim suspicions that Temple Grandin might be someone worthy of attention. But the actual draw was finding out what kind of person bore a name so sublimely exemplary of trochaic dimeter. I took the DVD home.<br/><br/>Few biopics shed light so penetratingly on autism. Not just on the isolation, exclusion, withdrawal, and social phobia that accompany it, but also, in this case, on the courage, eccentric brilliance, cross- species communion, and triumphs that it can occasion. Temple Grandin's life stands in glaring defiance of the denatured Newtonian materialism we take for absolute reality, for her understanding passeth all reason.<br/><br/>Of the dozen-odd people to whom I've recommended Temple Grandin, five or six actually watched it. More important, all were delighted they did.<br/><br/>By her very presence Temple Grandin the person, whom the movie-makers wisely consulted, very likely imparted quantum insight to a film that otherwise might have been reduced to pathos. (The DVD includes an interview with her.) Add to that Danes' interpretation, gifted writers, and deft direction by Mick Jackson, and you wind up with a film that's fascinating from start to finish. Yet in places it was so uncomfortable to watch that the eventual catharsis caught me off guard.<br/><br/>For a few days thereafter an unbearable lightness of musing set in. I was probably not alone in calling to mind anyone I'd ever known who was, or might have been, diagnosed with Autistic Spectrum Disorder. What if ASD proves one of the more cunning interventions Gaia has devised to show us how acutely our delusions and diversions have subverted our essence over the past dozen millennia?<br/><br/>If you feel any kinship with non-human animals, you likely won't regret seeing Temple Grandin. You'll discover how some ""disabled"" members of our species have re-established connections with myriad other species and habitats at the expense of the chattering mind. And you could find yourself aghast at what the rest of us have unwittingly put the Temple Grandins of the world through for nudging us homeward.</div>]",1278469
36494317,10 February 2018,"[<div class=""text show-more__control"">Very rarely does an actor/actress vanish into a role and become that person they are portraying. Claire Danes did just that. She stopped being Claire Danes, actress, and became Temple Grandin. 
A respectful and beautifully done telling of the inspiring life of Temple Grandin. Too bad we all cant be a little like Temple. As she says ""nature is cruel but we don't have to be"". 
Temple wasn't the only story here, the story of her mother, aunt and her teacher. The people that loved her, respected her and who really saw something special in a girl everyone thought was a weirdo and freak. They inspired her to be just who she was born to be. 
Bravo and a standing ovation.</div>]",1278469
